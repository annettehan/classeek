Artificial Intelligence: AI is a broadly based multidisciplinary area comprising theoretical, experimental, and
applied investigations of intelligent systems. Required: 1) EECS 492; 2) EECS 445 or 545; 3) one of EECS 442,
543, 545, 595; and 4) a 4th ULCS of student’s choice.
Bioinformatics: Computation plays an increasingly important role in modern biology. This is an interdisciplinary
track. Required: three ULCS courses- 1) at least two of: EECS 445, 477, 484, 485, 492; 2) a 3rd
ULCS course of student’s choice; 3) BIOINF 529; and 4) BIOLOGY 305 or MCDB 310. This track is not
open to Biology Majors.
Data and Information: Fast information storage and retrieval are crucial to many computer applications, and
manipulating large data collections on servers or networks pose difficult challenges for computer professionals.
Required: 1) EECS 445; 2) EECS 484; 3) one of EECS 477, 482, 485, 492; and 4) 4th ULCS of student’s choice.
Economics and Computation: As social and market interactions become more computational, computer science
has adopted more traditional economic concepts such as decentralized decision-making and allocation of
resources. This is an interdisciplinary track. Required: 1) at least one of: EECS 492 or EECS
547; 2) at least two of: EECS 475, 485, 492, 547, 588; 3) ECON 401; and 4) one of: ECON 406, 409, 431,
442. This track is not open to Economics Majors.
Robotics and Vision: Until recently most robots were stationary manufacturing devices, but they are rapidly
evolving into mobile information gathering and decision making platforms, with vision being perhaps their most
important information gathering capability. Required: 1) EECS 467; 2) EECS 442; 3) one of:
EECS 492, EECS 445, 542, 543, 567, 568; and 4) a 4th ULCS course of student’s choice.
Security: Security for hardware, software, and networked systems is one of the fastest growing areas of computer
science. Required: 1) EECS 388; 2) EECS 475 or 575; 3) EECS 482, 484, or 485; and 4) a 4th ULCS of student’s
choice.
Software Development: Designing and developing large software systems is a formidable engineering challenge
and is the primary enterprise of the software industry. Required: 1) EECS 481; 2) EECS 477; 3) EECS 485; and
4) a 4th ULCS of student’s choice.
Software Systems: Software systems are the tools and applications we use when we compute. Required: 1) at
least three of: EECS 388, 482, 483, 484, 489; and 2) a 4th ULCS of student’s choice.
Theory of Computation: Research on mathematical foundations has enormously influenced the development of
computer science, yielding advances in data management, communications, security, and may other areas. This
is an interdisciplinary track. Required: 1) EECS 477; 2) EECS 445 or 475; 3) one of: EECS 574, 575, 586; and 4)
two of the following: Math 412, 465, 425, 475, Stats 426, IOE 510, 512, 518, and EECS 550. This track is not
open to Math Majors.
