Accounting for Decision Making,"Through this course, you will start by addressing the two “big questions” of accounting: “What do I have?” and “How did I do over time?” You will see how the two key financial statements – the balance sheet and the income statement - are designed to answer these questions and then move on to consider how individual transactions aggregate to make up these financial statements. After developing a broad understanding of accounting and financial statements, you will begin to develop a more nuanced understanding of individual components of doing business, such as making a sale or building inventory.  By considering many of the more common actions of a company, you will build your understanding of accounting, and explore these concepts by applying them across various types of transactions. Once you understand these individual concepts better, you will be ready to return to the overall financial statements and use them as informational tools, including building ratios.

Climate Change and Adaptation,"Climate change is arguably the greatest environmental challenge facing the world. Unaddressed, it will lead to catastrophic and irreversible impacts on the prospects for greater human welfare and development, and the likelihood of environmental and natural resource conservation. The impacts of climate change are likely to be particularly severe for the most vulnerable and poorer peoples on the planet, and ecosystem services and biodiversity in more fragile environments. Further, the adverse impacts of climate change are likely to be exacerbated by ongoing global processes and stressors related to demographic shifts, market integration, economic growth, urbanization, and erosion of ecosystem services. We now know that even if the most optimistic assumptions about reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are realized, the global system is committed to a sizable change in global temperatures and precipitation. To begin to address the environmental and economic challenges associated with climate change, therefore, it is critically necessary to understand better how different human societies can adapt to social dislocations that climate change will inevitably produce.
 
The aim of this course is to provide students with a solid grounding in the social dimensions of climate-driven adaptation and the way it intersects with different global processes shaping livelihoods, especially in less developed regions. In examining the social dimensions of climate change, the course will introduce students to the key concepts and areas of knowledge related to climate impacts, vulnerability and resilience, historical human adaptations to climate variability, changes, and impacts, and future adaptation needs and adaptive development.",course

Crisis at the Border Teach-Out,"American media have extensively covered controversy surrounding the Trump Administration’s implementation of a “zero tolerance” immigration policy detaining migrant families seeking asylum in the United States, and separated children from their families.  The issue has triggered an intense torrent of media attention, social media activity, and heated conversations in both public and private spaces.

How do we make sense of this? The situation is rapidly evolving and raises larger questions around law, order, morality, and how these intersect with international crises in Latin America and around the world. How do we define our own internal debates and productively engage others to address the situation?

This Teach-Out will help you focus on key dimensions central to this issue, providing context on the policy, legal, and health implications of the family separation and detainment policies - and what the new Executive Order may mean for the future. It will also provide you with tools to have conversations around difficult, emotionally-charged topics like this, in order to help you productively engage with family and community members who may see this situation from a different perspective.

Join the conversation surrounding key questions in the immigration debate, including:

What’s happening now?
What’s the purpose of the zero-tolerance policy?  Is this a new policy?
What’s the impact of separating and detaining immigrant families?
What are the moral dimensions of this issue?
What’s being done to resolve this issue, and what could be done?",teachout

Doin' Time: Through the Visiting Glass (Seeking Justice: Conversations on Incarceration),"<p><i>Doin’ Time: Through the Visiting Glass</i> is a play which examines the impacts of incarceration on families. Ashley Lucas, the child of an incarcerated father, conducted interviews in California, Texas, and New York with family members of the incarcerated, formerly incarcerated people, and those who do work connected to prisons. She also corresponded with over 400 incarcerated people from across the U.S. Weaving together these interviews and letters with her personal experience as a prisoner’s child and creative writing, Lucas wrote a one-person play which she performs herself. Doin’ Time uses monologues to take the audience through a variety of perspectives on the families of the incarcerated. Since 2004, Lucas has performed Doin’ Time both inside and outside prisons throughout the U.S. and in Ireland, Canada, and Brazil.

Erfolgreich Verhandeln: Strategien und Fähigkeiten,"Wir alle verhandeln täglich. Auf persönlicher Ebene verhandeln wir unter anderem mit Freunden, Familie, Vermietern, Autoverkäufern und Arbeitgebern. Verhandlungen sind auch der Schlüssel zum Geschäftserfolg. Kein Unternehmen kann ohne profitable Verträge überleben. Innerhalb eines Unternehmens kann Verhandlungsgeschick zu Ihrem beruflichen Aufstieg führen. 

Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich den Hunderttausenden von Lernenden anschließen, die „Erfolgreiches Verhandeln“ zu einem der beliebtesten und am höchsten bewerteten MOOCs weltweit gemacht haben.  Im Kurs lernen Sie die vier Schritte einer erfolgreichen Verhandlung kennen und üben diese: 

   (1) Vorbereiten: Planen Sie Ihre Verhandlungsstrategie 

   (2) Verhandeln: Verwenden Sie Schlüsseltaktiken für den Erfolg 

   (3) Schließen: Erstellen Sie den Vertrag 

   (4) Ausführen und bewerten: Das Endspiel 

Um diesen Kurs erfolgreich abzuschließen und Ihre Verhandlungsfähigkeit zu verbessern, müssen Sie Folgendes tun: 

(1) Sehen Sie sich die kurzen Videos an (zwischen 5 und 20 Minuten). Die Videos sind interaktiv und enthalten Fragen, mit denen Sie Ihr Verständnis der Verhandlungsstrategie und -fähigkeiten testen können. Sie können Videos schneller oder langsamer abspielen, um sie an Ihr bevorzugtes Zuhör-Tempo anzupassen. Abhängig von Ihrem Zeitplan können Sie sich die Videos über einige Wochen hinweg ansehen oder alle sofort ansehen. Ein Kursteilnehmer, der sich gleich alles angesehen hatte, kam zu dem Schluss, dass „es so gut sei wie Breaking Bad“. Ein anderer Kursteilnehmer verglich den Kurs mit „House of Cards“.  In beiden Serien gibt es interessante Beispiele für komplexe Verhandlungen!

(2) Testen Sie Ihre Verhandlungsfähigkeiten, indem Sie die Verhandlung in Modul 6 abschließen. Sie können mit einem Freund vor Ort verhandeln oder mithilfe von „Diskussionen“ einen Partner aus einem anderen Teil der Welt finden. Ihr Verhandlungspartner gibt Ihnen Feedback zu Ihren Verhandlungsfähigkeiten. Um Sie bei Ihren Verhandlungen zu unterstützen, habe ich mehrere kostenlose Verhandlungsplanungstools entwickelt, die sich auf den Kurs beziehen.  Diese Tools und eine kostenlose App sind unter http://negotiationplanner.com/ verfügbar. 

(3) Legen Sie die Abschlussprüfung ab. Um den Kurs erfolgreich abzuschließen, müssen Sie 80 % der Fragen richtig beantworten. Die Prüfung ist eine sogannte Beherrschungs-Prüfung, d. h. Sie können sie so oft ablegen, wie Sie möchten, bis Sie das Material beherrschen.

Exploring Basic Income in a Changing Economy Teach-Out,"The United States social safety net is a complex system with many programs and often difficult eligibility requirements. Many of these programs only deliver in-kind aid (not cash) to people living in poverty, a lot of whom can fall through the cracks and can’t make ends meet. 

Basic income, the idea of providing people with a minimal level of cash support on a consistent basis, remains a point of debate in the United States and beyond. In this Teach-Out, you will join leading experts to explore the emerging idea of basic income and other associated social safety net programs. 

The Teach-Out will address the following questions:
What is basic income?
What is the difference between basic income and universal basic income?
Why is basic income generating so much interest now?
How does basic income work? What are the benefits and the challenges?
How might basic income help create an inclusive economy?
What is the social safety net? Who does it help and who does it leave out?
How do we currently measure poverty and determine who is eligible for safety net programs? 
How do automation and a changing economy affect the basic income conversation? 

Note: This Teach-Out originally launched in July 2018.

Reliable information is at the heart of what makes an effective democracy, yet many people find it harder to differentiate good journalism from propaganda. Increasingly, inaccurate information is shared on Facebook and echoed by a growing number of explicitly partisan news outlets. This becomes more problematic because people have a tendency to accept agreeable messages over challenging claims, even if the former are less objectively credible. In this teach-out, we examine the processes that generate both accurate and inaccurate news stories, and that lead people to believe those stories.

Fast Track Finance #1,"This course exposes you to the fundamentals of finance. We will first discuss the concept of time value of money in extensive detail with the use of several real world examples, and then apply the principles of valuation to value (a) real projects or ideas and (b) financial securities (stocks and bonds). Since decision-making virtually always involves risk and uncertainty, we will then introduce the concept of risk, and the relation between risk and return. This is followed by a discussion of the relation between financing and the weighted average cost of capital in a world without frictions. We will then integrate our knowledge of cash flows with our understanding of risk and financing to revisit valuation and decision-making. Although the concepts of competitive capital markets and market efficiency will not be covered in a separate session, they will be woven in the fabric of the course.

The pedagogy of the course is applied and problem-based with assignments in every module of the course that are each contain multiple problems that, by design,  become progressively more difficult. The assignments are all designed by the faculty lead and machine graded.",course

Finance for Ross,"This course is created for Ross students without any background in finance and exposes you to the basics. We will cover all topics that you will see in a core finance course, but at an introductory level so that you can ease into the field. 

We will first discuss the concept of time value of money in some detail with the use of several real world examples, and then apply the principles of valuation to value (a) real projects or ideas and (b) financial securities (stocks and bonds). Since decision-making virtually always involves risk and uncertainty, we will then introduce the concept of risk, and the relation between risk and return. This is followed by a discussion of the relation between financing and the weighted average cost of capital in a world without frictions. We will finally integrate our knowledge of cash flows with our understanding of risk and financing to revisit valuation and decision-making. 

The pedagogy of the course is applied and problem-based with assignments covering every part of the course thateach contain multiple problems that, by design,  are introductory and simpler than the more real-world applications you will confront in the real world and more advanced courses. The assignments are all designed by the faculty lead and machine graded.",course

Finding Common Ground Teach-Out,"Our world is evolving quickly. Technology is changing what we can learn about one another, what we can say to one another, and what we might be tempted to believe about one another. These changes are causing seismic shifts in our culture, in our economy, and in our politics. In a society where people have different experiences and diverse ideologies, achieving critical social goals requires listening to - and sincerely attempting to learn from - people whose views may be different than our own. These interactions can reveal new ways to identify shared values and show us how we can work together to make real progress on problems of common interest.

This Teach-Out is about how to overcome divisiveness, get beyond division, and work together. To that end, we present the Common Ground Framework for moving beyond partisanship and getting past polarization. Join the conversation and learn how to find common ground where it exists and how to build common ground where it is needed. 

The Teach-Out will address the following questions:
Is society more or less polarized than how the media presents it?
How can I find common ground where it exists or build common ground where it does not exist?
How can I learn to listen and learn from those who may have different ideological identities than myself?
How can I be more persuasive?
Can I work more effectively with diverse groups?

Improvement Science in Education,"<p>With roots in industry and in health care, improvement science is a disciplined approach to educational innovation that supports teachers, leaders, and researchers in collaborating to solve specific problems of practice. Improvement science brings discipline and methods to different logics of innovation by integrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem analysis</li>
<li>Use of research</li>
<li>Development of solutions</li>
<li>Measurement of processes and outcomes</li>
<li>Rapid refinement through plan-do-study-act cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>For teachers, school leaders, and system leaders, improvement science moves educational innovation out of the realm of “fad” and into the realm of research-based, evidence-driven continuous improvement, with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of educational practice.</p>
<p>That, in turn, will support schools and systems in responding to calls to improve opportunities to learn and student performance and calls to reduce achievement gaps by improving the day-to-day work students, teachers, and leaders.</p>
<p>In this introduction to improvement science, developed in collaboration with the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, learners will explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem-specific and user-centered design and analysis</li>
<li>Differences in implementation and outcomes as resources for improvement</li>
<li>Improving systems to improve practice</li>
<li>Driving improvement through measurement, evidence, and disciplined inquiry</li>

"Leading for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education","This course is open to professionals interested in learning more about leadership in higher education for a changing demographic or interested in developing their own leadership skills. The very idea that individuals can be taught to lead is not without its skeptics. Reasonable people, even some scholars in the field, point to the important traits, skills, and attributes that are observed in many visible leaders and contend that certain qualities necessary for effective leadership are not easily transmitted. To accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum. We believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming—if done well—can be transformative for organizers and participants.

Course Level Objectives:
Understand the historical narrative of institutions as well as institutional structures that have created instances of inclusion and exclusion in colleges and universities. 
Describe how transformational leadership is enacted for diversity, equity, and inclusion in a complex and contested environment.
Compare legislative, governance, and public accountability and expectations in relation to contemporary issues in higher education.
Analyze the strategic diversity planning process and documents of a selected institution. 
Recommend innovations and opportunities for transformational change at various levels of the ecological model using the strategic diversity planning process as a tool.",course

Leading People and Teams Capstone (LPT Iterations),"The capstone project will consist of three options, and you will complete one of them as part of the course.

The first option is working with senior-level executives to help them solve their most pressing leadership challenges. Two (2) senior-level executives from leading organizations will provide detailed descriptions of ongoing leadership challenges that they are currently facing within their organizations. The challenges will be real and current. You will be asked to help the executives think through how best to approach and address their respective leadership challenges. Specifically, you will be tasked with drafting a memo to one of the executives outlining your recommendations for how best to address the leadership challenge. To offer effective advice and counsel, you will need to use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the fundamental issue(s), and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations. The memos will be evaluated based on how effectively you apply course concepts to diagnose the problem and how well you link your proposed solutions to the diagnosis. The best submissions will be sent to the executives for their review, and each executive will offer feedback that will then be shared with the entire class to advance everyone’s learning.

The second option is to identify your own leadership challenge (e.g., at work, at school, in your local community). You should be directly involved in the challenge, and the challenge must align with at least one topic from the specialization. You will develop a presentation where you use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the core leadership challenge and barriers to effective performance, and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations for your own leadership challenge.
 
The third option asks you to interview an executive of your choosing. In this interview, you will ask questions about the challenges faced by that executive with respect to leading people and teams, as well as the practices used by the executive to address his or her challenges. In your written submission, you will use course concepts to organize the major leadership challenges faced by the executive, highlight the strategies and practices used by the executive to address the core leadership challenges, and then to evaluate the effectiveness of the executive’s practices related to leading people and teams.

LGBTQ Pride: From Origins to Evolution Teach-Out,"At its origin in the late 60s and early 70s, Pride in the U.S. was a radical claiming of space for LGBTQ individuals and communities. Today’s Pride has evolved to a hypervisible month-long celebration across different parts of the world, but Pride as a personal experience and representation of communities remains complicated. In this Teach-Out, we will discuss the history of Pride and what it means for individuals and communities today.

The Purpose of this Teach-Out is to dive deeper into the complexities of Pride as an event and as a feeling for individuals with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer community, also referred to as LGBTQ. We are hoping to shed light on the different understandings and meanings of Pride as it relates to space, community, and representation within LGBTQ communities. You will learn that Pride can be a celebration for LGBTQ individuals, but Pride also brings about tensions within the LGBTQ community about its purpose. The production team interviewed several individuals who self-identify within the LGBTQ community in order to provide you with direct narratives and experiences.",teachout

Listening to Puerto Rico Teach-Out,"On September 20, 2017, Hurricane María struck the island of Puerto Rico with catastrophic force, shattering lives, communities, infrastructure and the physical environment. One year later, Puerto Rico remains in the grips of an ongoing and systematic crisis. 

In June 2018, teams from the University of Michigan and the University of Notre Dame traveled to Puerto Rico  to film testimonies from Puerto Ricans from all walks of life. In this Teach-Out, you will hear powerful narratives of loss and recovery, abandonment and resilience, failure and hope as you come to better understand Puerto Rico’s past, present, and future. 

These individual testimonials are complemented by resources that are meant to deepen your understanding of an urgent multidimensional crisis that involves policy, culture and history,  political economy, environmental loss, civil infrastructure, public health, and human dignity. In this teach-out, we spotlight  a number of successful organizations, strategies and solutions that are contributing to Puerto Rico’s recovery. 

Understanding begins with listening. But “listening” is not just about hearing people’s words: it also implies taking notice of, and acting on, what people say. Shaped by the individual experience of everyday life, the Listening to Puerto Rico Teach-Out invites you to hear many voices from a distressed but resilient island and discover how you can contribute to the island’s recovery. 

This Teach-Out is a collaboration between the University of Michigan and the University of Notre Dame.

Mindware: Critical Thinking for the Information Age,"Most professions these days require more than general intelligence. They require in addition the ability to collect, analyze and think about data. Personal life is enriched when these same skills are applied to problems in everyday life involving judgment and choice. This course presents basic concepts from statistics, probability, scientific methodology, cognitive psychology and cost-benefit theory and shows how they can be applied to everything from picking one product over another to critiquing media accounts of scientific research. Concepts are defined briefly and breezily and then applied to many examples drawn from business, the media and everyday life.

What kinds of things will you learn? Why it’s usually a mistake to interview people for a job. Why it’s highly unlikely that, if your first meal in a new restaurant is excellent, you will find the next meal to be as good. Why economists regularly walk out of movies and leave restaurant food uneaten. Why getting your picture on the cover of Sports Illustrated usually means your next season is going to be a disappointment. Why you might not have a disease even though you’ve tested positive for it. Why you’re never going to know how coffee affects you unless you conduct an experiment in which you flip a coin to determine whether you will have coffee on a given day. Why it might be a mistake to use an office in a building you own as opposed to having your office in someone else’s building.

Model Thinking,"We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. 

The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!",course

MTC - Beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"We’re excited you’re here! This course, “Beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Addressing Sustainability and Development,” is the first course in the upcoming Sustainability and Development MasterTrack Certificate program (Fall 2020), but you can also take this course as a stand-alone learning opportunity. 

Sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity. In this course, we’ll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the world’s most pressing problems like climate change, poverty and inequality, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development (e.g. sustainable development), we conceptualize Sustainability and Development as co-equal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities. When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it requires us to think more explicitly about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them, which we will be exploring in depth in each week.

Throughout the course, you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in Sustainability and Development, and will garner an in-depth understanding of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of Sustainability Science.

In this course, we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including climate change, poverty and inequality, and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking. In the final week of the course, we will discuss the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between these challenges, especially as they relate to designing innovative solutions for achieving  our sustainability and development goals.

Negociações de sucesso: estratégias e habilidades essenciais (em Português),"Todos nós negociamos diariamente. No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família, proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários, entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa, as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.

Este curso fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios. O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento, (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. 

Cada estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para responder em negociações futuras, como:  
•\tQuais são os principais elementos em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?
•\tQue diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?
•\tQual é a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?
•\tQuais ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas psicológicas devem ser evitadas?
•\tQuais são as quatro principais questões de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?
•\tQuais conceitos e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  

Durante o curso, você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos) sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação. O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica. 

Dependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que ""É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad"".

Após assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.

Preventing Gun Violence in America Teach-Out,"Welcome to the Preventing Gun Violence in America Teach-Out. In response to the two mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio in early August 2019, we invite you to this interdisciplinary and timely discussion about gun violence and safety in the United States. Gun violence prevention is an urgent, complex, and multifaceted problem. A group of experts from the Firearm-safety Among Children and Teens (FACTS) Consortium in the the fields of public health, criminal justice, psychology, and emergency medicine discuss the state of gun violence and injury prevention in the U.S., and how data may inform possible solutions to these issues.   

Key Questions in this Teach-Out include:
Is gun violence in the U.S. increasing or decreasing? 
How do gun death rates compare to other causes of death in the U.S.?
What are a few intervention methods currently being used or considered to prevent gun violence?
What are common misconceptions about gun violence?",teachout

Principles of Valuation: Risk and Return,"This second course in the specialization will last six weeks and will focus on the second main building block of financial analysis and valuation: risk. The notion of risk and statistics are intimately related and we will spend a fair amount of time on the development of some statistical concepts and tools, namely distribution theory and regression analysis. This time will be well spent because these concepts and tools are also commonly used in many applications in the real world. The foundational idea of diversification will then be used to develop a framework for evaluating risk and establishing a relationship between risk and return. Apart from developing a keen appreciation of risk for making thoughtful decisions in an institutional context, this course will contain a lot of material and examples that will enable the learner to make smart personal investing decisions.  The course will again have time included for assimilation and two final exams.

This course is the second in a sequence of four courses that comprise a Specialization on Valuation & Investing.",course

Principles of Valuation: Time Value of Money,"We will introduce the time value of money (TVM) framework in a carefully structured way, using relatively simple applications at first and quickly moving to more advance ones. We will then spend some time on developing an understanding of alternative decision criteria (NPV, IRR, Profitability, etc.) that are commonly used in the real world.  We will wrap up the course with an exposure to the determination of cash flows using accounting principles. The main focus in this building block will be on individual/personal decisions because of two reasons: (a) we learn when we see value to us as individuals and (b) the beauty of finance is that the building blocks of finance are applicable to any decision, personal or corporate. The course will last six weeks with time included for assimilation and two final exams.

"Privacy, Reputation, and Identity in a Digital Age Teach-Out","Reputation has long been prized. In its traditional form, people who know something about you use this knowledge to form opinions. Their collective sense of who you are—your reputation—affects how people treat you: it shapes all of your social interactions.

In today's world, additional knowledge about you resides in ""big data"" collected by individuals, organizations, companies, and governments. Increasingly, data about you are being processed by algorithms to draw conclusions: to form something like opinions. 

This combination of data and algorithms creates a new digital reputation which increasingly shapes your life, from recommending purchases and suggesting friends to prompting actions based solely on your digital footprint.

Who gathers, owns, and controls this data? Where do they get it, and how? How do they use it? Is it shared with people, processed by algorithms, used to construct your choices? What should we think about all of this?

In this Teach-Out we will consider questions of privacy, reputation, and identity using a case study approach. Learners will hear from experts and engage in conversation using real-world scenarios across multiple topic areas.",teachout
Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking,"Have you ever heard that computers ""think""? Believe it or not, computers really do not think. Instead, they do exactly what we tell them to do. Programming is, ""telling the computer what to do and how to do it.""

Before you can think about programming a computer, you need to work out exactly what it is you want to tell the computer to do. Thinking through problems this way is Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking allows us to take complex problems, understand what the problem is, and develop solutions. We can present these solutions in a way that both computers and people can understand.

The course includes an introduction to computational thinking and a broad definition of each concept, a series of real-world cases that illustrate how computational thinking can be used to solve complex problems, and a student project that asks you to apply what they are learning about Computational Thinking in a real-world situation. This project will be completed in stages (and milestones) and will also include a final disaster response plan you'll share with other learners like you.

This course is designed for anyone who is just beginning programming, is thinking about programming or simply wants to understand a new way of thinking about problems critically. No prior programming is needed. The examples in this course may feel particularly relevant to a High School audience and were designed to be understandable by anyone.

You will learn:
-To define Computational Thinking components including abstraction, problem identification, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithms, and evaluating solutions
-To recognize Computational Thinking concepts in practice through a series of real-world case examples
-To develop solutions through the application of Computational Thinking concepts to real world problems",course

Resilient Teaching Through Times of Crisis and Change,"Resilient teaching is the ability to facilitate learning experiences that are designed to be adaptable to fluctuating conditions and disruptions. This teaching ability can be seen as an outcome of a design approach that attends to the relationship between learning goals and activities, and the environments they are situated in. Resilient teaching approaches take into account how a dynamic learning context may require new forms of interactions between teachers, students, content, and tools. Additionally, they necessitate the capacity to rethink the design of learning experiences based on a nuanced understanding of context. 

The course is designed with higher education faculty, lecturers, and graduate student instructors in mind, but may also be applicable to educators in a wide variety of instructional environments. The course is aimed at participants who may be asked to rethink how they teach in the immediate or near future due to the ever-changing circumstances of the current COVID-19 pandemic. While the creation of this course is motivated by the current crisis, we expect it will remain relevant to instructors who are faced with disruptions and change to their teaching for any number of reasons and must quickly adapt their course designs.

Risk and Return - Ross,"This second course in the specialization will last six weeks and will focus on the second main building block of financial analysis and valuation: risk. The notion of risk and statistics are intimately related and we will spend a fair amount of time on the development of some statistical concepts and tools, namely distribution theory and regression analysis. This time will be well spent because these concepts and tools are also commonly used in many applications in the real world. The foundational idea of diversification will then be used to develop a framework for evaluating risk and establishing a relationship between risk and return. Apart from developing a keen appreciation of risk for making thoughtful decisions in an institutional context, this course will contain a lot of material and examples that will enable the learner to make smart personal investing decisions.  The course will again have time included for assimilation and two final exams.

This course is the second in a sequence of four courses that comprise a Specialization on Valuation & Investing.",course
"Risk, Return & Valuation","This course is an introduction to the notion of risk, its relation to return, and the valuation of projects and companies. This is a capstone course to help you value projects and companies by applying your understanding of time value of money (TVM) and cash flows developed in the first three courses of this specialization. This course is part of a specialization titled “Foundational Finance for Strategic Decision Making” and is helpful if you are interested in applying to an MBA degree program or learning the foundations of finance to be more effective in your career. 

The pedagogy of the course is applied and problem-based with assignments covering every part of the course that each contain multiple problems that, by design,  are introductory and simpler than the more real-world applications you will confront in the real world and more advanced courses. The assignments are all designed by the faculty lead and machine graded.",course
Ross Finance - WMBA,"This course exposes you to the fundamentals of finance. We will first discuss the concept of time value of money in extensive detail with the use of several real world examples, and then apply the principles of valuation to value (a) real projects or ideas and (b) financial securities (stocks and bonds). Since decision-making virtually always involves risk and uncertainty, we will then introduce the concept of risk, and the relation between risk and return. This is followed by a discussion of the relation between financing and the weighted average cost of capital in a world without frictions. We will then integrate our knowledge of cash flows with our understanding of risk and financing to revisit valuation and decision-making. Although the concepts of competitive capital markets and market efficiency will not be covered in a separate session, they will be woven in the fabric of the course.

The pedagogy of the course is applied and problem-based with assignments in every module of the course that are each contain multiple problems that, by design,  become progressively more difficult. The assignments are all designed by the faculty lead and machine graded.",course
Ross Social Venture Fund: Introduction to Impact Investing,"Welcome to the University of Michigan Ross School of Business Social Venture Fund's MOOC on impact investing! We are excited to have you interested in impact investing education. 

Over the past decade, there has been an increasing recognition that some of society’s  critical needs are not being served by either businesses or governments. Several major  societal problems have in fact emerged due to the narrow focus of business and the  ineffectiveness of governments across the globe. In response to this difficult situation,  there is growing interest in a new organizational form, which we will loosely term  “social enterprise.” Such an enterprise attempts to invest in projects and ideas that are both financially sustainable and have a major social impact. In this important sense, such an organization has a much more complex objective function compared to the exclusive financial focus of the private sector or (at least the broadly claimed)  public good focus of governments.  

This course will use an economic/financial framework to develop methodologies to  enable social enterprises to serve their complex mission. Specifically, we will develop  frameworks to measure the financial and social impact of investment decisions.  Hence, the title of this course is Impact Investing. Given the recent emergence of the social enterprise, the course will have a major focus on issues confronted by social  “entrepreneurs.” The course however will also be very useful for managers of existing  private and public entities because they are increasingly being confronted with issues  that cross traditional boundaries of the private and social sectors. The modern  business manager needs to be increasingly aware of the broader social context and be  prepared to deal with all aspects of business decisions. Consequently, the course will  have a potentially large audience of students comprising our regular MBAs, our joint  program students, and even the much larger community of students at the University of Michigan. Although we will attempt to be as open-minded as possible, if only because the issues confronting social enterprises are so multi-faceted and complex, we will largely be  looking at issues from an economist’s standpoint. Such a viewpoint is obviously  limited, but we will hopefully emerge with both a better understanding of the issues  and practical ways of dealing with them. The course is unique in that the students will  be expected to become competent in evaluating both the financial and social impact of  their decisions.",course
"Sampling People, Networks and Records","Good data collection is built on good samples.  But the samples can be chosen in many ways.  Samples can be haphazard or convenient selections of persons, or records, or networks, or other units, but one questions the quality of such samples, especially what these selection methods mean for drawing good conclusions about a population after data collection and analysis is done.  Samples can be more carefully selected based on a researcher’s judgment, but one then questions whether that judgment can be biased by personal factors.  Samples can also be draw in statistically rigorous and careful ways, using random selection and control methods to provide sound representation and cost control.  It is these last kinds of samples that will be discussed in this course.  We will examine simple random sampling that can be used for sampling persons or records, cluster sampling that can be used to sample groups of persons or records or networks, stratification which can be applied to simple random and cluster samples, systematic selection, and stratified multistage samples.  The course concludes with a brief overview of how to estimate and summarize the uncertainty of randomized sampling.",course

Service Transformed: Lessons in U.S. Veteran Centered Care,"Improving health care for veterans has become a matter of national attention and has gained increasing attention from the medical community.  With the current surge of veterans reintegrating into civilian society it is critical to improve the training of the next cadre of providers who will provide care for our veterans.  It is widely known that veterans receive care in all aspects of the health system, thus providers in  veteran focused care facilities, military health serves and civilian locals must be aware of the unique needs of veterans.  It is perhaps even more important to educate civilian providers who may be unfamiliar with the unique physical, mental and emotional needs related to military service.

Course Audience
 - all health professions learners, example:
 - medical students, resident physicians, dental students,
 - nursing students, advanced practice nurses,
 - social work, pharmacy student as graduate level learners

"Sleep: Neurobiology, Medicine, and Society","The objective of this course is to give students the most up-to-date information on the biological, personal, and societal relevance of sleep. Personal relevance is emphasized by the fact that the single best predictor of daytime performance is the quality of the previous night's sleep. The brain actively generates sleep, and the first section of the course is an overview of the neurobiological basis of sleep control. The course provides cellular-level understanding of how sleep deprivation, jet lag, and substances such as alcohol, ,caffeine, and nicotine alter sleep and wakefulness. The second section of the course covers sleep-dependent changes in physiology and sleep disorders medicine. Particular emphasis will be placed on disorders of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep-dependent changes in autonomic control. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs immune function and may promote obesity. Deaths due to all causes are most frequent between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m., and this second section of the class highlights the relevance of sleep for preventive medicine. The societal relevance of sleep will be considered in the final section of the class.

SPH BIOSTAT 593: Design for Health Studies,"Many courses in Biostatistics focus on how to analyze data, with little attention being paid to where the data came from and how it was collected. This course focuses on the design of health investigations, with particular attention to the role of randomization in the selection of units and the allocation of treatments. 
The first part will focus on probability sampling designs and alternatives for the selection of units from a population. The second part concerns study designs for comparing treatments or assessing potential risk factors for health outcomes. These designs include randomized clinical trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies, and clinical databases. 
Some of the key concepts we will cover include accuracy and precision of estimates, the definition of causal effects, internal validity and the role of measured and unmeasured confounders, and external validity and the role of effect modification on the generalizability of study findings. We will look at examples of randomized and nonrandomized studies to illustrate concepts.

SPH BIOSTAT 594: Applied Generalized Linear Models,"Generalized linear model (GLM) is a broad class of regression models useful to investigate the relationship between an outcome variable and predictors. The multiple linear regression model, a member of this class, is used when the outcome variable is continuous. This course considers non-continuous continuous variables such as binary (presence or absence of a disease), count (the number asthma attacks in the previous two weeks), multinomial (unordered categorical variables), ordinal (ordered categorical variable such as Likert scale, self-rated health) as well as continuous variables that have skewed distributions and subject to censoring. This graduate level course will cover application of these models to address substantive public health problems. The emphasis will be on applications, inference and interpretations. However, the course will also cover the underlying mathematical formulations of GLM. The R-package is the primary software used to analyze public health datasets, evaluate underlying assumptions, and assess model fit. The other standard software, SAS, will be briefly covered.",course
SPH BIOSTAT 595: Applied Longitudinal Analysis Using R,"This course provides an overview of statistical methods for analyzing correlated data produced by longitudinal measurements taken over time.

SPH EHS 591 : Environmental Toxicology in Communities,"Toxicology is the science that deals with the health effects that can result from exposure to chemical, biological, and physical agents in the environment. In some communities, these exposures are compounded by historical inequities, and the legacy of unequal distribution of risks arising from racism and discrimination. Polluting industries are more likely to be located in low-income, and/or minority communities making members of these communities more vulnerable to individual and cumulative impacts of hazard exposures. The environmental justice framework, beginning in the early 1970s, highlighted how these communities faced disproportionate risks from environmental hazards. These exposures occur over the life course with adverse health impacts being evident in adulthood. Understanding the mechanisms by which these individual and cumulative exposures influence health outcomes is important to inform policy that promotes health and reduces health disparities     . 
This course will focus on:
1. The fate of chemicals in our environment, particularly those resulting from environmental racism,
2. The routes of exposure and measures taken to decrease these exposures, particularly for vulnerable communities.
3. Approaches that are commonly used by public health officials when dealing with toxicants in environmental justice communities, and 
4. The application of these concepts to the understanding and prevention of morbidity and mortality resulting from environmental exposures to toxic substances, particularly in vulnerable communities.",course
SPH EHS 592: Infectious Disease and Emergency Response,"Infectious disease outbreaks negatively affect people at the individual, community, regional, national, and global levels. Mitigation and management of infectious diseases through prevention, preparedness, and emergency response are critical to public health infrastructure. 
This 3-credit course will provide students with an understanding of infectious disease outbreaks and control, the current infrastructure in the United States to address infectious diseases and deploy emergency response, the role public health practitioners have in emergency response, and how gaps in infectious disease and emergency response in communities can be addressed. Moreover, the course will explore how a lack of environmental and social justice, as well as racism, exacerbate the harmful outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks and lead to inequitable emergency response. Events explored in this course include naturally occurring and environmentally mediated infectious disease outbreaks, with case studies focused on the Great Lakes region of the United States.

SPH EHS 593: Risk Assessment for Decision-Making,"Risk assessment focuses on estimating the risks of environmental factors to human health. Risk assessment for public health decision-making integrates knowledge from various disciplines and perspectives. Understanding the nature and extent of environmental hazard exposures, combined with other scientific evidence including uncertainties, would allow public health practitioners to create and support responsible risk management and policy decisions. In this course, we will explore all the major components of risk assessment, exposure assessments, the underlying assumptions and uncertainties, risk modeling, methods for evaluating the risks, environmental statutes (e.g., TSCA), and the implications for decision-making communities. We will review how environmental racism influences exposures in communities and contributes to environmental justice communities and we could use risk assessment as a policy tool to improve the life of these communities. 

Students who take this class will be able to:
1. Describe the steps involved in, and be able to perform, a qualitative and quantitative risk assessment.
2. Define risk management and identify means for controlling risk including interventions, legislation, and regulatory guidelines.

"SPH EHS 596: Climate, Justice, Health & Sustainability","Climate Change is arguably one of the most significant public health challenges of the 21st century. It is widely recognized that climate change will pose significant risks to health, environment, society and the economy. With the focus of achieving a more sustainable future, the United Nations developed 17 Sustainability Development Goals including several goals interconnected with climate change including good health and well-being, reduced inequalities, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, and climate action. Inequalities permeate the impacts of climate change on communities. To take effective climate action that simultaneously acts to reduce inequalities we must focus on climate justice if climate action is to result in resilient communities.

In this course, we will focus on an overview of the science of climate change, health impacts through the lens of climate justice, environmental justice (EJ) and climate action and community resilience from the perspective of EJ communities, Indigenous communities, and/or rural communities and the disproportionate risks they face. We will also focus on the role of climate change science in policy-making for creating more sustainable communities – the interface between policy and science.

This course is very interactive where you will be expected to engage with the material in various ways to produce several products and working documents that could realistically be utilized in various settings for climate action. The course culminates in a policy brief to a governor and individualized action plan.

SPH EHS 672: Healthy and Sustainable Food and Products - Life Cycle Assessment,"This course showcases a variety of quantitative decision making tools towards healthy and sustainable foods and products. It helps evaluate production processes and consumption decisions by considering their human health and environmental impacts over the life cycle of products. It is designed both for SPH students to help developing preventative approaches for evaluating and mitigating the human health and environmental impacts associated with products and levels of consumption and for graduate students across UofM Schools (SEAS, Engineering, Business School, etc.) interested in a life cycle approach to sustainable consumption.

- How can one hot dog lead to 35 minutes of healthy life lost? 
- How environmentally friendly is popcorn as a packaging material? 
- How far should we feel responsible for particulate matter in China associated to traded goods? 
- How can I assess the impacts of the chemicals in 100,000 products on the shelves of my supermarket? What small targeted changes can make a big difference? 

To learn how to answer these questions, we offer you this fall this course (EHS 672), on the use of life cycle assessment as a tool towards healthy and sustainable foods and products. It addresses the sharply rising demand from US consumers and companies to provide reliable tools to assess and reduce impacts of production and consumption on health and the environment. The course starts by addressing the major determinants of environmental health using the global burden of disease estimates. It then presents how to assess the nutritional and sustainable performances of 5800 foods of the US diet, analyzing trade-offs between environmental, affordable and healthy foods. To assess the environmental impact of products and systems over the whole product life cycle, from cradle to grave, students are then introduced to the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA1 ) methodology applied to products and services, practicing each of the four LCA phases. A special focus will be given to the characterization of comparative risks of toxics substances on human health, in particular of chemicals in consumer products. This leads to the discussion of the potentials and limitations of quantitative LCA compared to other assessment tools such as risk assessment and environmental impact assessment. provide an overview of the impacts generated by consumers and by the students themselves.

Leading actions in several industrial sectors (agriculture and foods, automotive, personal care products, and energy) will be examined through relevant case studies in order to demonstrate how effective environmental life-cycle assessment leads to new product development. Interactive group work and discussions will also take place during class and an LCA case study of your choice will enable you to start practicing LCA.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Identify the key factors impacting health and the environment, including the roles played by products. 
2. Assess and compare the nutritional and sustainable performances of foods, accounting for both the consumer health and the environment.

4. Set the fundamentals for comparative risks of chemicals in consumer products. 
5. Adequately relate risk and impacts on human health to consumption and production, from single products to sustainable consumption.",course
SPH EPID 590: Epidemiological Methods,"Have you ever wondered if getting more sleep might improve your health? Or if that terrible stomach bug that you had last week was the result of eating the strange-smelling salad at your work picnic? Were you ever curious if there are more C-sections now than there used to be or wondered how scientists concluded that the Flint water crisis likely contributed to a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires disease? Perhaps you wanted to know how many lives would be saved in India if the air pollution levels came down to levels more commonly found in the US. If so, then epidemiology is the study for you since it is a scientific and data-driven approach used to answer these types of questions. 

In this course, we will teach you how epidemiologists study the frequency, patterns, and determinants of health in different populations. You can expect to learn:
- The terminology, principles, and methods of population-based epidemiologic research.
- How to critically appraise epidemiological research. 

The course will be divided into the following three sections:
Section 1 will serve as an introduction as to the way in which epidemiologists measure and describe trends in morbidity and mortality as well as the risk factors for these endpoints. In this section we ask: What are the trends? Do they differ by time or place? Where do we get the data to study these trends and how do we know if our information is any good?
 
In Section 2, we will learn how epidemiologists conduct studies to try to understand causality. Here we address the following questions: What is causality? How do we design studies to determine if something increases or reduces the risk of morbidity or mortality? What are the measures that we use to characterize associations and how certain we are in those estimates? 

Section 3 teaches students to identify situations in which the data that we collect in epidemiological studies can mislead us and lead us to reach the wrong conclusions. Students will learn different types of problems that can bias our conclusions and will develop instincts as to the directionality and magnitude of these biases.

By the end of the course you can expect to be able to:
- Calculate and interpret measures of event frequency to describe population patterns of health-related risk factors and health-related outcomes in terms of person, place, and time

Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills,"We all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement. 

I hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have made “Successful Negotiation” one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs worldwide.  In the course, you’ll learn about and practice the four steps to a successful negotiation: 

   (1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy 

   (2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success 

   (3) Close: Create a Contract 

   (4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game 

To successfully complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you’ll need to do the following: 

(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes). The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another learner compared the course to “House of Cards.”  Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!

(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/ 

(3) Take the final exam. To successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.

Sustainable Construction Practices,"The construction industry is generally one of the largest contributors to the economies of most countries around the world. Construction produces the buildings we live and work in, and the infrastructure required to support our daily activities including water systems, power systems and transportation.
 
The economic and social benefits of a booming construction industry cannot be overemphasized. At the same time, construction projects require a significant amount of resources including material, energy and water. Most of these resources come from non-renewable sources resulting in rapid depletion of important reserves. The production of these resources generates significant amount of emissions that are harmful to human health and the natural environment, results in polluting of natural habitats and ecosystems and generates solid and liquid waste. Similar adverse effects on the environment occur during the life cycle of the building or infrastructure project.

To address these challenges, the construction industry has endorsed sustainable construction methods to ensure that construction projects minimize their environmental impacts while supporting the economic wellbeing and social welfare of the communities in which they are developed.",course
Sustainable Food Teach-Out,"What we choose to eat matters. Did you know that a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions come from food and agricultural systems? One way each and every one of us can take to reduce our impact on the environment is to change what is on the end of our forks. 

Join other participants and a range of experts in this Teach-Out to explore the complexities of the food system and how we can, individually and collectively, create food habits that reduce our impact on climate change. We break down behaviors in three parts: 1) what we choose to eat, 2) where we source our food from, and 3) reducing food-related waste. This Teach-Out originally launched in April 2019. Since then, we've added a new module of content focused on food justice, access, and equity. 

We hope this Teach-Out inspires and empowers you to make changes you feel support our collective journey toward a more sustainable global diet. 

This Teach-Out will address the following questions:

Why are food choices so difficult?

Why is food choice so important for reducing greenhouse gas emissions?

What is the difference between a beef hamburger and a plant-based hamburger in terms of environmental impact?

Where are my food-related emissions coming from?

What does diversity, access, equity, and justice mean in the context of our food systems?",teachout

The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics,"This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.

The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an
introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is
natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not
formal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a
competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional
analysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the
methods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite
Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical
foundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner
presented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed,
although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.

The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):
elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to
the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in
one dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We
then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and
mass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems
in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next
(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in
three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to
questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who
followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical
development to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.

Books:
There are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required
textbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader
treatments than can be provided in any form of class:

The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, T.J.R.
Hughes, Dover Publications, 2000.

The Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals, O.C. Zienkiewicz, R.L. Taylor and
J.Z. Zhu, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2005.

The Future of Gerrymandering Teach-Out,"One of the biggest challenges facing our democracy today occurs when congressional district lines that are drawn by elected officials to give one political party an unfair advantage over another. This is called ""gerrymandering.” This Teach-Out explores the topic of gerrymandering, considering everything from its history of the original gerrymander, to past, present and future United States Supreme Court cases. You will hear from leading experts on gerrymandering as well as citizen groups who are on the front lines of redistricting debate. 

This Teach-Out originally ran in June of 2018, before the United States Supreme Court decided on the Gill v. Whitford case coming out of Wisconsin and while various ballot initiatives around redistricting reform were evolving. 

What’s new? 
This updated version contains all original content, plus updates from returning faculty instructors Nancy Wang and John Chamberlin, who examine  the current status of the Gill v. Whitford case as well as other redistricting reform efforts (i.e. ballot initiatives, congressional action) from across the United States. If you previously participated in this Teach-Out, feel free to skip directly to the new update segment.

The fundamental driving questions from the original Teach-Out remain the same for this updated version, have a look here:

What is gerrymandering? 
What is happening now? Why is this such an important issue today and what does it mean for you?
Why did the United States Supreme Court take up the gerrymandering case (Gill v. Whitford)? 
How has technology impacted the gerrymandering debate? 
What are states doing to address the issue?
How can you implement change?

The Science of Success: What Researchers Know that You Should Know,"This engaging course is designed to help you achieve the success that you desire. Drawing on decades of scientific research, you will learn what the most successful people do differently than others, why IQ is not the most significant predictor of success (and can sometimes backfire), and why many commonly held beliefs hold people back from achieving their goals.

Although this course is based on the science of success, you will learn many practical ideas that you can apply to your own life immediately, particularly in three main areas:

•\tGetting better results at work (and school) 
•\tAchieving career success (however you define success) 
•\tEnjoying a meaningful, happy, and healthy life

By the time you finish this course you will know more than most people know about what predicts success in life. One of the most important lessons you’ll learn is that success is earned day-by-day through small wins - small, achievable actions that together can help you achieve your goals sooner and exceed even your own expectations. Therefore, you will have an opportunity to complete a detailed action plan through which you can turn what you learned into specific steps for achieving your most treasured life goals.",course

In this Teach-Out we will be speaking with leading experts across the disciplines of law, political science, and public policy as well as former federal prosecutors and political candidates. 

We recognize that impeachment of any elected official can be a hyper-partisan event, one that often splits along party lines or is  wrapped up in deeply rooted personal and political ideals. We wanted to create this Teach-Out as a learning experience and an opportunity where everyone, despite political opinion, can join and have a productive and respectful conversation. Rather than focusing on current events that are changing daily, this Teach-Out aims to provide context by exploring the legal and political processes of impeachment, the history of impeachment in the U.S. and the implications that impeachment may have on the U.S. moving forward. 

In this Teach-Out we will cover the following questions:
What are the legal and political processes of impeachment? 
What are the different forms of congressional oversight and where does impeachment fit in? 
How do lawmakers frame decisions around initiating impeachment proceedings? What’s at stake?
