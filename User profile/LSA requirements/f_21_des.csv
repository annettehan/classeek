First Year Social Science Seminar,"This course seeks to introduce students to everyday life in urban Africa. The course is designed to equip students with basic and useful knowledge about the how urban residents – rich and poor, newcomers and old-timers, young and old, men and women – negotiate the challenges of living in cities.  This course focuses on networks, associational life, and relationships that are the ties that bind urban residents together.  Social organization, religious belief and practice, ethnicity, economic and political systems, the arts, and popular culture are some of the topics we will explore.  We will be approaching these themes from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including history, anthropology, literature, political science, sociology, and economics.","Stein,Howard",AAS,103,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Reading Africa: Critical Perspectives on Popular Development Books,3,SS,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",(Cross-Area Courses).

First Year Social Science Seminar,"Blood diamonds. Resource curse. Land grabs. The tragedy of the commons. These concepts are often used to frame discussions about natural resource politics and environmental management in Africa. Time and again, we hear that corruption (in government) and overexploitation (by poor citizens) are preventing sustainable development, putting biodiversity conservation at risk, and providing fodder for ongoing conflict. This course prompts students to critically engage with these narratives through an appraisal of popular media, policy documents, and relevant scholarship in the fields of political economy, geography, anthropology, political ecology, and development studies. In doing so, we aim to uncover substantiations, deviations, and contradictions in cases across the African continent. Students will leave the course better equipped to interrogate the ways in which environmental and development challenges are shaped and landscapes produced by the complex interplay of local, national, and global forces.","Klein,Brian",AAS,103,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Reconsidering African Environments,3,SS,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",(Cross-Area Courses).

First Year Humanities Seminar,"When Rosa Parks refused to leave her seat on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama one fateful afternoon in December 1955, the stage was set for what would later become the modern Civil Rights Movement, launching the public careers of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and other civil rights leaders and organizations.  What is less widely known, however, is how Black and white activists in the American South during the 1950s and 1960s have come to inspire nonviolent political and social movements, worldwide, to the present day.

Utilizing historical literature, biography, and documentary film, this course will feature both an in-depth study of the origins, structure, and development of the American Civil Rights Movement, as well as focus on the success, and failings, of a select number of nonviolent struggles worldwide.

First Year Humanities Seminar,"This course looks at the historical and cultural development of food provisioning within African American culture. We explore how certain foodstuffs become traditional through the multi-ethnic societies of the early United States as well as in more recent historical moments like the Great Migration, the Dust Bowl, and the Black Power Movement. We will work to connect these moments to the everyday spaces of African American life by examining how domestic science, retail catalogs, radio, and television contribute to the symbolic meanings of food. By the end of the semester, students will better understand the contexts within which African Americans debate the value of group identity through food.

First Year Humanities Seminar,"#RepresentationMatters has become a popular hashtag and saying but why? What is the impact of what we see in the media on how we view others and ourselves? This course explores that question by looking at two stigmatized groups, Black Americans and American Muslims, and how they are represented in US popular culture. We will examine and compare stereotypical representations of these groups on TV and in film and the roles these stereotypes play in shaping what the American public “knows” about Black people and about Muslims. In this course, students are introduced to important concepts of popular culture and the skills to interpret music, film, and television so they learn to look critically at the relationship between race, religion, and popular culture. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify and analyze popular culture’s explicit and implicit uses of race and religion, have a solid knowledge of theories on media and representation and be capable of making their own cultural critique.","Abdul Khabeer,Su'ad",AAS,104,"Fall 2021, ",Section 008," - Race, Religion, and Representation",3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",(Cross-Area Courses).

Introduction to Afro-American Studies,"What do Kendrick Lamar, Ida B. Wells, Marcus Garvey, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison have
in common? Each of these figures are thought leaders about the condition of Black life in the
United States of America. What can we learn from understanding the lives, experiences, and
histories of Black Americans from enslavement to the present? This course provides an
interdisciplinary introduction to the field of African American Studies through careful attention
to the social, cultural, political, economic and historical realities of Black life in the U.S. In

Introduction to African Diasporic Studies,"Is the African Diaspora a concept or an actual geographical location? Is it singular or are there multiple African diasporas? What does diaspora have to do with the multi-lingual, multicultural continent of over fifty countries that make up Africa? What impact has Africa and its diaspora(s) had on the so-called “white” West and its development as a site of tremendous wealth and privilege? AAS 202 engages these questions by exploring the long historical, economic, and political relationships between ""the West"" (e.g., United States, Britain, France, and Germany) and selected countries in Africa and the diaspora (e.g., Jamaica, Haiti, Brazil, Mali, Liberia, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Africa). Topics include: pre-colonial African empires; the Middle Passage; child soldiers; public health; conflict minerals; slavery and resistance; migration; empire, colonialism, and post-colonialism; twentieth-century freedom movements; religion; and popular forms of cultural expression.","Khan,Aliyah R",AAS,202,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Global Blackness,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Africa to 1850,"The history of early Africa is expansive, encompassing several millennia and several thousands of square miles. It entails the peopling of a continent, the rise of centralized kingdoms and long-distance trade networks, technological innovation, the birth of diverse cultural forms and social identities, violent confrontations, and creative ideas about what it means to live together. It is also a difficult history to access as most African civilizations before the 19th century prioritized unwritten forms of communication. This class presents several important episodes in the long history of early African civilization and introduces students to the ways historians of the distant past think about and use various forms of evidence including language, material culture, oral traditions, and folklore.","Poteet,Ellen Spence",AAS,246,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
"Law, Race, and the Historical Process, I","AAS 450 is the first half of a two-course sequence on the constitutional and legal history of African Americans.  It covers the phase of this history that begins with European exploration of the western hemisphere, and ends as we set the stage for the advent of the Modern Civil Rights movement.  A unique backdrop for our work throughout the term will be the historical significance of the year 2005.  This is, among other things, the 50th anniversary of two pivotal events in the history of the Modern Civil Rights Movement — the murder of 14 year old Emmett Till in Money Mississippi, and the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. It is the 40th anniversary year of the passage of the monumental Voting Rights Act of 1965. If the events of 1955, along with the historic Brown decision of the year before, represented the opening salvo in the Modern Civil Rights Era, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, combined with the other legislative foundation posts initiated in that era, and was the practical policy steps taken to usher in an era of operational equality in American life. 

AAS 450 will look, however, at the origins of this central challenge of the 20th and 21st centuries. That challenge, essentially is to resolve the “birth conflicts” present as the North American colonies and later the United States take shape. In looking at the how and why questions of law in the time period from 1400-1900, AAS 450 will focus upon the conceptual underpinnings of the study of race and law in the U.S., the era of Constitutional formation, the dynamics of law in the antebellum period, the possibilities and limitations of law in Reconstruction and thereafter, and the halting nature of the quest for power and presence during the period of Jim Crow segregation.

The Political Economy of African Development,"The course introduces students to the confluence of political and economic forces at the local,
national, regional, and global levels that have helped shape the trajectory of African development.
The course is divided into three parts: the first examines the meaning and evolution of the political
economy of development in the context of Africa’s unfolding history from pre-independence
through the era of structural adjustment. The second applies an understanding of political economy
to topical development issues such as environment and climate change, causes and consequences of
conflict, health and development, and international aid. The latter section applies the political
economy framework to particular African country case studies.","Stein,Howard",AAS,260,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Political Economy,3,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Afro-American Literature,"In this course we will study the emergence and early development of African American literature, from 1773 to the Harlem Renaissance. We will do literary close readings of texts to think through many of the issues relating to the development of an African American literary tradition. What constitutes a tradition? Can there be more than one? Along with these questions, we will examine our own assumptions about this literature and the many ways in which these texts reflect the different experiences of African Americans intent on gaining a national voice in a slaveholding and racially polarized nation.","Santamarina,Xiomara A",AAS,271,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,AAS 111 (CAAS 111).,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Black women in Popular Culture,"Popular culture is an important site for creating, challenging, and transmitting meanings about race, gender and sexuality. What can we learn about race and gender using the lens of popular culture? In this course, we will examine how Black women construct and are constructed by popular culture in the U.S. by building a set of critical tools that can help us navigate this rich terrain. We will explore topics such as representations of Black femininity, Black sexuality and representation, stereotypes, and subversive media, over a wide range of popular culture artifacts. And we will consider the impact and meaning of Black women such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Janelle Monaé, Michelle Obama, and Janet Mock.","Kelow-Bennett, Lydia  ",AAS,275,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Selected Topics in Black World Studies,"How does a spider trounce a lion? And why do so many African princes send emails promising immense wealth while showcasing such poor financial skills? During this course, we will examine the evolution of the trickster figure from folk literature to modern texts. Tricksters are found in different literary traditions, from ancient religious writings to modern detective fiction. They are as diverse as Kweku Ananse, Brer Rabbit, or Odysseus. While certain texts, particularly those from monotheistic cultures, tend to be wary of the trickster’s untrustworthiness, others regularly embrace his subversiveness.
We will read from the Jero plays, The Fortunes of Wangrin and Diaries of a Dead African, and dip into online sketches. We will ask if it would be right to call the African trickster a culture hero. Whose side is he on, really? How do the reader and the society relate to someone who can convincingly be argued as problematic but is also entertaining? We will tackle these questions by focusing on textual analysis and how we judge African literary texts.","Ellsworth,Scott A",AAS,290,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004, - Hoop Dreams: Race and Basketball in America,2,,Minicourse,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Race and Ethnic Relations,"This course examines the central tensions underlying race and ethnic relations in the United States. For more than sixty years, sociologists have been preoccupied with the study of inter-group relations, assimilation, and racial and ethnic conflict. Indeed these issues have grown more complex and nuanced as the United States becomes more racially and ethnically diverse.  Our goal is to examine the social processes that facilitate or impede inter-group relations. We will devote attention to:

 theoretical debates in the conceptualization and analysis of race and ethnicity 
  developing a historical understanding of the antecedents of society’s most pressing social problems
  analyzing how various racial and ethnic groups construct and use their social identity.

"Gender and Immigration:  Identity, Race, and Place"," Refugees, migrants, immigrants, diaspora groups, and transnational actors are all terms that describe people who undertake different acts of mobility or travel across borders to seek refuge. But how are these terms different? This course focuses on these various acts of mobility to show how they are labeled differently under different political and social circumstances. We examine the gendered cultural and political meanings people and governments give to mobility, border-crossing, and displacement in this turbulent time in the era of globalization and transnationalism.

 

In this course we will also emphasize the experiences of both old and new generations of immigrants in order to understand the historical context of migration, globalization, and the processes involved in the imagination of place and nation building. One important lesson that students learn in this class is that the political processes that define the often-conflated meanings attached to the refugee, immigrant, and diaspora population cannot be divorced from histories of nationalism and transnationalism and their deeply rooted constructions in gender, race, ethnic, and class relations. Race, ethnicity, and sexism are significant components, and the course addresses them through cross-cultural ethnographies, media reports, documentary films, art, and other texts to explain how citizens and non-citizens are marked differently based on both legal and cultural terminologies.

 

Students also learn that systems of racialization and discrimination don’t just happen at the moment of border-crossing or when refugees, migrants, and diaspora populations settle in new homelands; these modes of exclusion are also experienced in various forms in their countries of origin. Some of the forces that lead to situations of refugee-ness, migration, and dispersal include religious, ethnic, gender, racial, and political discrimination encountered at home.  The course examines the different forms of these discriminations and how refugee, immigrant, and diaspora communities encounter them, live them, negotiate them, and resist them through their own cultural practices and other strategies of activism.

 

We will particularly explore how questions of power, race, and class intersect to shape refugees and immigrants’ daily struggles for justice and human rights. How do refugees and immigrants attempt to create and “imagine” their own social world with reference to their new locations and their homelands? Our readings and discussion will focus on cultural and theoretical perspectives from the social sciences, specifically anthropology, history, and literature.  And we will take as examples the ethnographies and narratives of immigrants from different parts of the world, specifically Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome.","Fadlalla,Amal Hassan",AAS,304,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Refugees of Unjust Worlds: Globalization, Gender and Nation",3,SS,,The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Global Health in African Contexts,"This course examines ""global health"" in African contexts.

Atlantic Slavery and the Making of the Modern World,"This upper-level seminar will examine systems of unfree labor in Africa and the Americas during the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade. Beginning with European colonization of the Americas and ending with the emancipations of the nineteenth century, the course will explore the labor and cultural practices of enslaved people as well as the evolution of slavery as a legal and economic institution. Although slavery was a global institution, we will pay special attention to the way that the organization of labor and the heritage of slavers and slaves created different societies in different parts of the Americas. We will also consider longstanding debates in the history of slavery such as the origins of racial slavery and forms of slave resistance. And throughout the course we will always consider the legacy of Atlantic slavery and how it continues to unfold in the problems and promises of our world today.","Spooner,Matthew Patrick",AAS,310,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Advanced Swahili I,"While Intermediate Swahili focuses on daily life through an emphasis on conversational and communicative approaches, this course addresses advanced issues related to culture, literature, politics, society, sociological studies, and gender. Samplings of East African films are viewed occasionally to help students improve comprehension and analytical skills. The overall intended learning objective is to enable students to critically analyze Swahili texts and discourse, and express ideas in Swahili at this level. The instructor uses situational dialogues, folk tales, songs and written literature to teach the students about societal issues and values. To reinforce the language learning and its daily uses, students undertake an independent study.","Mpesha,Nyambura",AAS,315,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,AAS 216.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Introduction to Environment Politics:  Race, Class, and Gender","This course introduces students to global environmental politics, justice and development. This course will explore environmental issues around the world and the relatedness of nature to politics, development and culture. We will address historically unique social form that presents special challenges to our understanding of environmental politics, gender, race and culture by looking at case studies from around the world. Among the questions that we will examine are the following: How have local and global histories, memories, practices, values, gender, race and identities that derive from our understanding of politics intersect with nature? Are there environmental issues that are also issues of race, class and gender?  For example, are there particular forms of knowledge and subjectivity that intersect or interact with race and gender difference, or ideas about civilization and primitivity that could be seen as distinctive instruments of environmental rule?","Adunbi,Omolade",AAS,322,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Introduction to Environmental Politics: Race, Class and Gender",4,"ULWR, SS, RE",,,(Cross-Area Courses).,May not be repeated for credit.,
Black Feminist Thought and Practice,"What is Black Feminism? In this course, we will explore the history of Black women’s gendered and racial politics in the United States and, in particular, how their beliefs and experiences have differed from other groups. How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism. Course readings are drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods with the goal of exposing students to the history of Black Feminist thought and the breadth of Black Feminist scholarship, activism, and methodologies. By the end of the semester, students will be conversant in the major concepts of Black Feminism and Black Women’s Studies and have developed the analytical tools to understand how race, gender, and class interact to produce the unique experiences of Black women in the United States.","Strongman,Saraellen",AAS,323,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Black Feminism(s),3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Various domains of development are examined (e.g., racial identity, self-esteem, academic motivation and achievement, physical health).  The course reflects an emphasis on both positive and problematic development, and gives attention to social policies and interventions that can potentially improve the lives of African American children and their families.

It also includes lesser-known texts: novels published serially in West African newspapers; editorial writings from early Christian converts; a play from a beleaguered Ugandan author. We’ll be studying how African writers, in their creative work, participated in the political and moral arguments of their time. Literature was not an escape from real life. African writers did work in their texts: they conjured up audiences, fired them with a shared vision of the past and the future, and set them on a forward path together. By studying the social and political work that African writers did, this course explores the intersection of literature and history, and of imagination and politics. The course is organized around three national literatures: the literatures of Nigeria, of Kenya, and of South Africa. In each of the case studies we’ll be tracing the historical development of a particular literary tradition, studying how authors commented on the changing politics of their homelands. We’ll also be exploring a set of cross-cutting themes that draw the three case studies together. Some of these texts define and defend a national community. Other texts depict the crisis of urban life in twentieth century Africa. In the whole of our work together we’ll be asking a set of questions about the vocation of the literary writer. What were these authors doing in their own time? What was literature good for?","Peterson,Derek R",AAS,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Race and Identity in Music,"This course explores the parameters of racial and ethnic identities in music. From the discourse surrounding exoticism and Orientalism, to the effects of evocative instrumentation, the use of dialect, and foreign subjects, the focus of this class is to understand how racial and ethnic difference can be portrayed musically. Musical case studies will be drawn from the nineteenth century through the present with a strong emphasis on the genre of opera.  Central questions to be raised are: how is racial/ethnic difference expressed musically? Who is representing whom? What is the intersection between the original performing context and our understanding of these works today? This course encourages interdisciplinary dialogue. Readings will be drawn from post-colonial and cultural studies as well as musicology.","Andre,Naomi A",AAS,354,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Race and Identity in Music,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Democracy and Development in Africa,"Countries in contemporary sub-Saharan Africa vary greatly in their quality of democracy, the strength of the state, and levels of economic development.

Topics in Black World Studies,"What does it mean to be “black” in Jewish culture? In this course, we explore how Jewish societies have understood and engaged with Blackness and Black peoples over the ages. Delving into the parallel struggles of Blacks and Jews, we ask: How does the history of slavery intersect with the status of Jews in the Middle East? What connections can be drawn between the civil rights struggles in Israel and America? Throughout the course, we discuss the flexible and interrelated nature of the categories of Blackness and Jewishness across different historical, geographical, and temporal contexts. Themes explored include black and Jewish anti-colonial thought; Ethiopian and North African Jewish history; race and racism within the Middle East. By the end of the course, students will better understand how diasporic and racial identities are constructed and reconstructed over time and space.","Roby,Bryan Karle",AAS,358,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002,,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,

In this course, we will explore how and why black writers have returned to the topic of slavery with remarkable frequency and depth, over a century after abolition. Our organizing questions will include the following: How do contemporary novels and poems about the slave past reflect and address our racial present? What is the relationship of historical fiction to history proper, and to the scholarly study of history? How is the literature of historical trauma tied up with questions of moral responsibility, past and present?","Levy-Hussen,Aida",AAS,358,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004, - Mind and Soul: African American Mental Health and Mental Illness in Slavery and Freedom,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,

"Global Perspectives on Gender, Health, and Reproduction","Feminists and anthropologists have produced voluminous work on the body as a site of gendered and sexualized practices.  Building on this rich corpus of literature, the course uses the body as a point of entry to examine the constructions and meanings of gender, health and reproduction, and their constitution of social differentiation.  By using various cross-cultural examples, we will discuss how gender, racial, and class differences are enacted and manifested in the divisions of social spaces and in bodily conduct, function, hygiene, and sickness.  In its entirety, the course attempts to introduce students to the complexity of the local and global processes underlying the cultural production of gender identities and social differentiation.","Fadlalla,Amal Hassan",AAS,365,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,One course in either Women's & Gender Studies or AAS.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

"Flawless/Formation/Freedom: Writing About Race, Gender and Popular Culture","This is a creative non-fiction writing workshop in which we will think about creative nonfiction writing as cultural reportage. We will read a survey of cultural reportage—primarily personal essays, reviews, and opinion pieces—for textual, cultural, and aesthetic analysis to think about the ways that race, gender, and sexuality intersect and operate thematically and politically in that writing. Our study of this writing will impact the main focus of this class: It is a writing workshop, in which each student will present her or his work for critique. Writing assignments will be expected of each student and possibly lead to the production of a class-produced blog or magazine at the end of the semester.","Poulson-Bryant,Scott",AAS,393,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, HU",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Looking at African Things,"In southeastern Nigeria, an Igbo proverb tells us, ""You can't view a performance standing in one place."" In the West, however, an understanding of African visual culture has long been centered on the practice of exhibiting African objects out of their vital contexts—rendering them motionless, making them available to our consuming vision, mapping out onto them our own systems of value. Such a practice has unfolded especially in museums dedicated to the exhibition of objects categorized as ""African Art."" But it is not these objects alone that are made to represent ""Africa"" so problematically; in world's fairs, theme parks, adventure tours, and other cultural expositions, living Africans too are transformed into things, into images of themselves. In this course, we will examine the history of how African objects have become ""African Art"": What are the terms by which African people describe the objects they create and use? What are the translations that allow us to consider those objects within the canons of Art History? What is excluded from those canons, and why? How are such strange and even violent transformations a metaphor for how African people have been transformed into objects? And what do African artists themselves have to say about it?","Doris,David T",AAS,407,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,HISTART 208/AAS 208.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

"Culture, Class, and Conflict in Southern Africa","In 1994, observers proclaimed the end of apartheid in South Africa a ""miracle"" and applauded the creation of a vibrant, inclusive democracy in that country.  Nearly quarter of a century later, vast economic inequalities remain, unemployment has worsened, and urban voters are beginning to abandon the ruling African National Congress.  Is democracy in danger in South Africa?  Why have economic disparities persisted? How are South African citizens navigating political and economic hardships and expressing their discontent?   This course explores the legacy of apartheid and the resulting spatial compartmentalization of housing, neighborhoods, schools, clincis, and social life in South Africa.  It will investigate the institutionalization of racist and segregationist legislation under apartheid, as well as the protests and resistance that followed from such acts.  We will examine the legacies left by legislation such as the Group Areas Act that defined living space according to the colour of one's skin or the Bantu Education Act, which created separate educational experiences for whites and blacks.  The course will cover successive democratic elections since 1994 and discuss the contemporary challenges posed by the lack of jobs, housing, and other goods; the ANC as a dominant party; persistent educational inequities; and the strains of urbanization and immigration. Finally, we will also examine the expression of hope and resistance in popular culture, from radio programs and blogs to student demonstrations.  Where appropriate, we will draw on theoretical and empirical research in comparative politics to situate the South African experience in relation to other countries that have had a history of segregation and/or have undergone transitions to democracy.","Pitcher, Anne  ",AAS,453,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Culture, Class and Conflict in Southern Africa",3,ULWR,,AAS 200.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Issues in Black World Studies,"This seminar is designed to introduce students to the study of political violence in Africa. The course specifically examines domestic or intra-state manifestations of violence through a variety of theoretical and empirical approaches. Over the course of the semester, we will see that violence is not something endemic to the continent; instead, we will investigate violence as the outcome of political and economic conditions and processes. To do so, we will consider specific events in African countries while also using social science concepts and methods to examine and explain broad patterns across the continent. In conducting this exploration, we will primarily rely on and build upon the work of political scientists, but will also draw on the contributions of journalists, anthropologists, psychologists, economists, and historians.","Davis, Justine Maisha",AAS,458,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Political Violence in Africa,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,
Issues in Black World Studies,"How does race translate across space, empire, and time? How do we disentangle the legacies of colonialism from our scholarly practices? Taking an historical approach to race, this course brings together theories of spatial and temporal difference as a means to deconstruct static notions of race with a focus on Anglo- and Franco-imperial settings. 

Within this wide regional breadth, the course examines racial configurations of whiteness/blackness and Arab/Jewishness within Israel/Palestine; colonial North Africa; and the Americas. Additionally, students develop skills in applying spatial and critical race theories to the digital humanities as a means of engaging with scholarship as an anti-racist practice. 

Theorists examined include: Michel Foucault, Edward Soja, Henri Lefebvre, Sara Ahmed, W.E.B. DuBois, Doreen Massey, and Oren Yiftachel","Roby,Bryan Karle",AAS,458,"Fall 2021, ",Section 006,,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,
Senior Seminar,"
This course explores cities in contemporary Africa through the lens of work and livelihoods, mobility and circulation, informal economies and survivalist strategies, architecture and the built environment, film, art and culture, social justice and citizenship.  One goal of the course is to critically evaluate how and why cities in Africa are often portrayed in dystopian terms and in negative stereotypes. There is an unfortunate tendency in journalistic, scholarly accounts to portray cities in Africa as examples of distressed, distorted, truncated, or failed urbanism.  This view that “cities in Africa just don’t work” is a fairly widespread perception that has embedded itself in both academic discourse and in popular culture.  Rather than treating cities in Africa as undifferentiated places of socio-economic malaise, famine and war, infrastructural failure, and service breakdown, the course seeks to understand the complexity of processes at work that produce cities in Africa today.  This course fulfills the Upper-level Writing Requirement.  Because giving and receiving feedback about writing enables us to develop our abilities as writers, peer review workshops will play a central role in our course.","Murray,Martin J",AAS,495,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Contemporary Africa and the World,4,ULWR,,Upperclass standing.,(Cross-Area Courses).,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).  ,

We will approach Detroit from the perspectives of race, gender, sexuality, democracy, urbanization, suburbanization, industrialization, de-industrialization, emergency management, and the future. In thinking about the future, we will think about the extent to which Detroit is representative of American and other urban futures, and to what extent is the exception. We will also examine Detroit's place in the world. How does it compare to Mumbai in India, Johannesburg in South Africa, and how does it compare to Berlin in Europe? Finally, we will work with a group of young people who live in and are growing up in Detroit. We will learn not only how to see Detroit from their perspectives, but also how to collectively produce films about it.

Seminar in Black World Studies,"In this course we will study African American literature written from the end of the 19th
century—known as the ""nadir"" (lowest point) in African American history—through the
beginning of the 20th century, the moment that gave birth to the ""New Negro"" of the
Harlem Renaissance. These decades represent a period of intense cultural production that
reflected both pessimism about post-Civil War racial violence in the US and optimism
over new opportunities for black artists. How did African American writers conceive of
the role of letters and literature in the national debates over freedpeople’s rights to
citizenship? How did they try to represent differences in the black community with
dialect and invocations of the “folk,” and how did they mobilize these cultural forms in
their search for new racial, political ideals? And finally, we will discuss the methods and
issues pertaining to the periodization of African American literature and history in the
Academy. Readings include novels, poetry and short stories by noted and less familiar
authors, including Charles Chesnutt, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Paul Laurence
Dunbar, Pauline Hopkins and Sutton Griggs, in addition to secondary critical material.","Thompson, Heather Ann",AAS,558,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Policing Blackness in America,3,,,Graduate standing or permission of instructor.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,

Introduction to Space Physics,"The course is designed to give a wide-ranging introduction to the physics of the space environment, with a mixture of theory and phenomenological description. It deals with the atmospheres and magnetic fields of the Sun and Earth, as well as the low density plasma filling the interplanetary space, the magnetosphere and ionosphere. It is important to get a good feel for the orders of magnitudes of physical quantities, and to understand why things in the space environment work as they do. 
Differential calculus, vector analysis, and some basic knowledge of differential equations are needed. Since nearly all the matter in the space environment is in the form of plasma (ionized gas), basic understanding of how plasmas behave will be developed during the course.

It will look at two periods of intense interest in memorials and ask what they can teach us not only about who Americans have said they are but also about structures of inequity in the United States and how they are maintained. This First-Year Seminar will use lots of different disciplines - history, history of art, architecture, design, political science, and cultural studies - to explore both these questions about monuments and larger questions about culture and meaning-making.

We will examine and compare stereotypical representations of these groups on TV and in film and the roles these stereotypes play in shaping what the American public “knows” about Black people and about Muslims. In this course, students are introduced to important concepts of popular culture and the skills to interpret music, film, and television so they learn to look critically at the relationship between race, religion, and popular culture. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify and analyze popular culture’s explicit and implicit uses of race and religion, have a solid knowledge of theories on media and representation and be capable of making their own cultural critique.","Abdul Khabeer,Su'ad",AMCULT,103,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Race, Religion, and Representation",3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.

Themes in American Culture,"Feathered headdresses. Face paint. War whoops. These are markers of the stereotypical Indian in American popular culture. They are easy to see and often easy to condemn. The American public increasingly wants to know that when they see a Native American the clothing/regalia is accurate, the person wearing it is authentically Native, and the encounter is not one of appropriation. But what do we mean by accurate, authentic, and appropriation? How can we be sure of what those concepts demand of Native and non-Native people? This course focuses on one piece of the long history of Native American representation in American popular culture: authenticity and its evidence. We will read cultural productions (e.g. images, literature, film, music, plays) that depict Native Americans in order to identify how these cultural objects explain and defend a particular notion of Native American-ness. Tracking the relationship among claims to authenticity, evidence proving those claims, and assumptions about suitable evidence we will seek to recognize the underlying logic in American ideas of Indianness. We will work to dissect this logic to ascertain its foundations, reveal its instability, and uncover its insecurities. This course is suitable for Native American Studies Minors, the Ethnic Studies Sub plan, and those interested in the representation of minorities in American popular culture.

This class provides a historical overview of the development of various racial, ethnic, gender, sexual, and socio-economic stereotypes in the United States. Together, we will interrogate how and why stereotypes are inscribed through mass media and used as a technology of social and political power. We will examine a wide range of media texts, including cinema, advertising, television, print, and televisual news media, and other forms of visual culture and media, in conjunction with interdisciplinary readings in media studies, race and ethnic studies, and gender and sexuality studies. The goal of this class is not simply to identify if a stereotype is negative or positive or debate whether or not stereotypes are harmful. Rather, the goal is to understand what role stereotypes have historically played in American culture and the impact stereotypes have on politics, social relations, and the material reality of daily life in the United States.","Cable, Umayyah  ",AMCULT,204,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Stereotypes in American Culture,3,HU,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

Turning to Nazi cinema and post-Holocaust films produced in Germany, France, the U.S., and Israel, we interrogate the use of the medium for propaganda, documentation, and witnessing. The course also introduces students to Israel as an immigrant society and to the cinematic representation of Jewish and Arab minority groups. Throughout the course, we reflect on casting choices, language use and subtitling, cross-dressing, and genre choices, as these affect the cinematic construction of Jewishness in relationship to other social groups.","Barzilai,Maya",AMCULT,204,"Fall 2021, ",Section 005, - Screening Jewish Cultures,3,"RE, HU",,,,May be elected four times for credit.

Among other questions, we’ll consider how and where manipulation, truth, and ethos mediate what we popularly describe or understand as bullshit. We’ll think together about how complex appeals to lived experience and alternative data circulate among certain communities of practice online, with particular attention paid to anti-vaccination discourse. We’ll not only examine what it means to argue on the interwebs, but we’ll also ask what it means to imagine digital rhetorical practices that center on questions of ethics, justice, and power.","Yergeau, M Remi  ",AMCULT,204,"Fall 2021, ",Section 009, - Bullshit and Digital Rhetoric,3,HU,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

Topics covered include representations of the mafia as an indigenous Sicilian movement, protecting the property and the rights of Sicilians; laws enacted to fight the mafia; and the antimafia, a youth movement that works to reclaim land and property from the mafia. We study the spread of mafia crime in the US, from New Orleans in the nineteenth century to New York, Las Vegas, and Chicago in the twentieth century. Students also research the little-known history of the Detroit mafia, who exploited the presence of the auto industry and the Teamsters Union, the proximity of the Canadian border, and their ties in Sicily, between Prohibition and the 1990s.","Mallette,Karla",AMCULT,205,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Italian Mafia,4,"RE, HU",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
"Motor Nation: Car Cultures, Race, and Gender","This class analyzes and studies the history and evolution of cars and car cultures in the United States and its influence in Michigan. It uses the intersections of gender, class, race, and historicity as points of departure to understand the unique relationship that America has with cars, the car industry, and its developments. This class explores cars not just as transportation devices, but rather as a system of meanings and values, and as an everyday ubiquitous cultural product influenced by economic, political, and social forces.","Calvo-Quiros,William A",AMCULT,212,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Latina/o Studies,"Latinas/os (or Latinxs) are now the largest ethnic minority group in the United States. Combined, they have been credited with swaying marketing trends, popular culture, and local and national elections. Yet, most professions are scrambling to find individuals with the cultural competencies to respectfully engage and understand Latinx communities. This class offers such skills and information for students interested in careers in health, education, law, media, business, and politics. It offers an interdisciplinary and practical approach to the study of Mexican-American (Chicana/o or Chicanx), Puerto Rican, Cuban-American, Dominican-American, Central American-American, and other U.S. Latin American communities in the United States. Students understand not only the interconnections among these diverse communities, but also the differences that sometimes divide them.","La Fountain-Stokes,Lawrence M",AMCULT,213,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"ID, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Asian/Pacific American Studies,"“Asian American,” “Pacific Islander,” “APA,” “APIA,” even “APIDA”—these identifications encompass people whose heritage and ancestral homelands range from the Pacific Ocean across East and Southeast Asia to—and including—the Indian subcontinent. This course examines its diverse historical and contemporary experiences in the United States. 

By examining history, cultural productions,  and the political struggles of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, the course learning goals are as follows: 

Understand Asian migration to the U.S., to describe its past and present patterns, and to identify the legal, political, economic, social, and cultural circumstances that have shaped it.
 Understand the racial formation of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and to understand how these formations intersect with other racialized communities in the U.S.
Compare and contrast Asian/Pacific Islander American communities in the U.S. and to relate their past and present development in light of domestic and international conditions.
Analyze the diverse expressions of Asian/Pacific American identity as they intersect with other forms of identity, such as gender, class, sexuality, and religion.
Articulate informed positions on some of the mechanisms of exclusion and invisibility experienced by Asian and Pacific Islander American communities. 
Think and communicate analytically and compassionately about race and ethnicity in America. ","Desai,Manan R",AMCULT,214,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Introduction to Arab-American Studies,"Students will explore questions such as: What are the historical circumstances that have shaped Arab immigration to the U.S.? Where do Arab Americans “fit” within the U.S.' racial classification system? What is anti-Arab racism? How has it shifted throughout Arab American history? How did September 11th impact Arab American communities? What are the cultural forms that Arab immigrants have inherited from their homelands and reproduced in the U.S.? What is the relationship between socioeconomic class and cultural identity among Arab Americans? How have Arab Americans used the arts for cultural and political expression? What is the significance of religious affiliation to Arab American identity formation? How has U.S. foreign policy impacted Arab American histories and experiences? This course explores questions such as these in an interdisciplinary context, focusing on anthropological, historical & literary materials.

Introduction to American Muslims,"This undergraduate course teaches major events, fields, and debates that continue to shape American Muslim attitudes, priorities, inequalities, and interactions.  It covers a brief history of Muslims in the USA beginning with the European conquest of the Americas through the present time.  From media to fashion, sports to politics, medicine to commerce, stigma to discrimination, or race to sect, the course incorporates a variety of voices frequently positioned as representative of “Muslim Americans” along with the critical issues and arguments in the field of Muslim American Studies.  Beyond the depth and breadth of topic area knowledge, through this course, students will gain critical research, writing, and presentations skills that will benefit them regardless of their primary concentration.","Khalil,Nancy",AMCULT,216,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Introduction to Native American Studies,"What makes a person “native” to “America?” Is being Native American decided by race, kinship, citizenship, or place of origin? Why is there an entire field devoted to this group of people? Why do they keep showing up in Westerns and as sports mascots? Why do they care about pipelines and the Department of the Interior? This course provides a broad overview of the people, the questions, the issues, the history, and the current conversations that comprise Native American (and Indigenous) Studies. In it, we will explore the presence, persistence, complexity, and vitality of Native Americas. This course connects our location (Michigan) to our past (history of the University of Michigan) to our present (21st-century interactions with Native people and Native Studies on campus). It asks what it means to live within the context of the United States as indigenous communities with unique identities and inherent sovereignty. We will trace developments within Native American and Indigenous Studies to situate our own curiosity within the broader, global field to better understand the shape of scholarly inquiry in an Ethnic Studies paradigm. This course is suitable to those interested in a Native American Studies minor, an Ethnic Studies sub plan, or those who are curious about the relationship between Native Americans and their own lived experience.

Elementary Ojibwe I,"This course represents American Culture's long-standing commitment to Ojibwe language instruction and preservation. We will make every effort to offer a four-semester sequence so that students can use it to satisfy their LSA language distribution. Students should be aware, however, that remarkable circumstances might not make it possible for the department to do so. If you have questions or concerns, please contact ac.ug.services@umich.edu.

The course will serve as an introduction to Anishinaabe language and culture. This course is for students who have no previous knowledge of the tribe as well as tribal members interested in learning more about their culture and language. Because Ojibwe is an endangered language, it is of utmost importance that we make sure the language is learned and used. This is a beautiful language with much to teach about living in this place. It deserves to be revitalized for future generations. 
After completing AMCULT 222 students should be able to use Ojibwe to:

Respond to and initiate simple statements and commands such as greetings and introductions.

Understand 250 – 500 words.

Express reactions and courtesy phrases.

Express likes and dislikes.

Describe actions, people, places, and things using short phrases.

Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies,"A survey introduction to the critical, theoretical, and historical study of women and gender from feminist and cross-cultural perspectives. Readings range across a wide body of feminist scholarship in order to familiarize students with key questions, theoretical tools, and issues within the field. The course aims to sharpen critical awareness of how gender operates in institutional and cultural contexts, in students’ own lives, and the lives of others. Two questions are central to the course:

How is gender created and maintained through social practices (e.g., ideology, media representations, social norms)?

How do gendered social practices intersect with other social categories, such as race, ethnicity, class, disability, and sexuality?

Because Women’s and Gender Studies grew out of activism, this course will explore the relationship between how we generate critical knowledge about gender and how we work to use this knowledge to promote social justice at gender's intersection with other identities. The course materials are drawn from the US but also other cultural contexts.Course Requirements:Course requirements include short writing assignments, active participation in the discussion section, and a final project that asks students to build on their own interests.","Alexy,Allison",AMCULT,240,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Art of the American Century (1893-1968),"The 20th-century United States was the emblem of all things modern, but how would Americans make modern art? This lecture/discussion class surveys art and the visual and material environment from the emergence of the United States as a world power in the 1890s to the questioning of the ""American Way of Life"" by Pop and activist artists during the era of the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. In lectures, discussion, and original hands-on-research, we will examine the work of such celebrated figures as Frank Lloyd Wright, Jacob Lawrence, Georgia O'Keeffe, Isamu Noguchi, Edward Hopper, Walker Evans, Andy Warhol, and Diego Rivera, but also the culture of consumerism and emergent racial and ethnic identities— in media from painting to furniture to photography to graphic design and propaganda posters—in which they worked.

Topics in American Culture,"Media is a powerful tool. The term “media activism” refers to how media is used to campaign for or bring about social or political change. This class will primarily focus on how underrepresented identity-based and cause-based groups in the United States have used different kinds of media forms and practices in the service of social justice activism. We will examine various social movements, including AIDS activism, Black Lives Matter, the anti-war movement, Palestine solidarity, and Occupy Wall Street, and examine the media texts and practices these movements employ, such as culture jamming, street art, documentary, and narrative film, film festivals, public television, social media, and memes. We will read interdisciplinary texts from the fields of film and media studies, critical race and ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, and postcolonial studies to interrogate the relationships between representation and power, and to identify how and why certain forms of media activism emerge at particular historical moments.","Cable, Umayyah  ",AMCULT,301,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Media Activism,3,HU,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

Topics in American Culture,"This course will introduce students to the practice of public history—how history is put to work in the world. We’ll consider museum exhibits, walking tours, historic houses, monuments, oral history, crowdsourcing, podcasting, robotic presidents, and more. We’ll learn how public historians work with a variety of audiences to present difficult or contested pasts, like the 1967 Detroit uprising or antebellum plantation homes. We’ll consider how public history can be used to subvert or reinforce colonialism and empire—and how it can be used to promote social justice. 

What, if anything, is compromised and lost in this process? How do factors like design, venue, and writing style affect how history is consumed? How can historians share authority and develop true collaborations with communities?

Using case studies, we will grapple with these issues as a group. Students will walk away with a basic understanding of public history and knowledge of what direction they might take if they wish to pursue a career in the field.Course Requirements:When meeting in person, this course will convene weekly for a two-hour session, including a short lecture, discussion, and collaborative work/student presentations. When presented online, the course will convene for a shorter synchronous session focusing on discussion and collaborative work/student presentations.

American Immigration,"That America is a nation of immigrants is one of the most common, yet truest, of statements. In this course we will survey a vast range of the American immigrant experience: that of the Irish, Germans, Jews, Italians, Chinese, Japanese, Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Mexicans. Immigration to America can be broadly understood as consisting of four major waves:


the first one, that which consisted of Northwest Europeans who immigrated up to the mid-19th century

the second one, that which consisted of Southern and East Europeans at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th
the third one, the movement from the south to the north of Black Americans and Mexicans precipitated by the two world wars
the fourth one, from 1965 on, is still ongoing in the present, of immigrants mostly from Latin America and Asia.



At all times, our effort is to understand the immigrant past of these ethnic groups, both for what it tells us about the past as well as their present and possible future.Course Requirements:
            The requirements for this class consist of two essay exams (blue books, in class) comparing and contrasting a couple of immigrant groups along an important issue; and a final  research paper (about 20-25 pages long), both drawing from lectures and readings.
 
            In the research paper the topic is your family’s history as the immigrant social history of a particular ethnic/racial group that unfolded over the course of a number of generations.  The central question that will help guide you is whether the experience of your own family was typical or not. The paper should tell your family’s story as an immigrant family, 1) assessing the reasons for their migration to the U.S. as well as 2) the extent to which they experienced cultural and structural assimilation in America.
 
Both the exams will be in-class tests, consisting of one essay and a few short-answer questions that will draw from the lectures, the documentaries, and the discussion of the readings.

American Culture and the Humanities,"This course explores the changing cultural and social value of food in American life through a range of different sources, disciplines, and case studies. We will be guided by how convenience, responsibility, and identity shape our relationship to the dynamic American food industry while paying attention to how immigration, trauma, and appropriation constitute the industry itself. By doing so, this course seeks to help students connect the food histories, policies, and myths that converge to define American belonging.","Walker, Jessica Kenyatta",AMCULT,311,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Food in American Culture,4,"RE, HU",,,,May be elected four times for credit.

American Culture and the Humanities,"Stories of undocumented immigrants are often couched in terms of silence and invisibility, using expressions like “living in the shadows” and “under the radar.” Many Immigrant rights activists, on the other hand, resist this silence and invisibility and see storytelling as a political act that makes the humanity of the undocumented impossible to ignore. This class is about the politics and literature of visibility in narratives that reveal undocumented lives, as well as the theory of literature as a tool for social justice. The texts we will study illuminate the people and circumstances behind undocumented immigration, the policies that make documentation precarious and out of reach, and the sweeping generalizations and dehumanization behind terms like “illegal alien.”","Anderson,Sigrid Michelle",AMCULT,311,"Fall 2021, ",Section 005, - Literature of the Undocumented,3,HU,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

American Culture and the Humanities,"Revolutionary Theatre is theatre that explores our expectations of what can be done both on and off the stage, that cries out for a world more just than our own, and that models how to work together as equals for the benefit for all. At least, this is the vision held by many theatremakers in the US 1960s, who responded to that decade’s utopian dreams by inventing new strategies to transform the hearts and minds of audiences. Among these strategies was a collective creation, abandoning top-down leadership by a director/playwright in favor of devising work as a group. Other strategies included meeting audiences on the street and in their communities, using “environmental” stage designs, and crafting mythic or expressionist (rather than realist) dramaturgies.","Fitzgerald,Jason",AMCULT,311,"Fall 2021, ",Section 006, - Revolutionary Theatre: US 1960s Radical Theatre Groups,3,HU,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

This Engaged Learning course challenges the understanding of what it means to be empowered and how to be an agent of empowerment. Students will intern at community-based organizations that serve youth using arts disciplines such as theatre games, the visual arts, creative writing, poetry, rap and dance. The internships involve a range of time commitments ranging from 3-5 hours per week. In addition, the class meets once a week.  
The class fosters students’ ability to apply the expressive arts as a catalyst for change in issues of social justice. Students learn how the arts are applied as healing tools in response to trauma and the impact of racism and classism on equal access to services and educational resources for youth in the United States. The internship experiences prepare students to engage in diverse settings as well as provide opportunities to communicate across differences, operate with humility, and be exposed to the realities of youth living in our community.","Gordon-Gurfinkel,Deborah Mae",AMCULT,311,"Fall 2021, ",Section 007, - Empowering Community through Art,3,HU,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

Topics to be considered include the meaning of diasporas in our time, Fidel Castro and the making of the Cuban Revolution, masculinity and gay sexuality in the Revolution and Cuban diaspora, women's dreams, everyday life under communism, Afrocuban culture and religion, Jewish-Cuban revitalization, the Cuban visual arts movement, and the construction and deconstruction of exile identity.","Behar,Ruth",AMCULT,313,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Issues in Race & Ethnicity,3,"SS, RE",,,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Studies in Native American Literature,"An expression coined in 1983 by critic Kenneth Lincoln, “Native American Renaissance” refers to an American Indian literary movement that came into existence following N. Scott Momaday’s receipt of the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for his novel House Made of Dawn. Momaday was not our first successful Native American writer – Indians had been publishing in the English language fairly continuously for the previous two centuries – but he was the first to receive a major American literary award. Since literary movements and awards do not happen in a historical vacuum, we should observe that the Native American Renaissance was happening at the same time as the “Red Power” Indian civil rights movement: a highly visible, sometimes notorious, and generally militant series of occupations of public spaces by young Indian activists. Although the two movements were rather different in both form and content, this class will read the Native American Renaissance literary movement in – and just as often against – the Red Power movement. Most of the literary texts we will study are modernist novels from the nineteen-sixties and seventies; they are aesthetically ambitious, artistically brilliant, and sometimes challenging. In addition to Momaday, our authors will include Leslie Marmon Silko, James Welch, and Gerald Vizenor.","Lyons,Scott Richard",AMCULT,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Media Matter: From Print to Screen Culture,"Media determine our situation. This course explores their history. How have technologies such as photography, film, radio, and the computer altered the human senses, our relationship to space and time, to each other, to institutions and governments? In what ways do new technologies shape the questions we ask about the natural world and the answers we give? How have critical approaches for thinking about media evolved over the past two hundred years, and what contributions have German-speaking thinkers in particular made to media theory? Drawing on a wide range of materials including scholarly articles, primary documents, photographs, films, literary texts, and audio recordings, we will work to develop a critical vocabulary and historical framework for analyzing the varied and widely distributed effects of technological change on both patterns of thought and physical reality, the imagination and the body, social relations, and their material networks and infrastructures. Topics include the so-called ‘reading revolution’ in late eighteenth-century Europe, print culture and the Enlightenment, human mediumship, spiritualism, and the occult, technology, and science, sound recording and the voice, radio and the Third Reich, cyborgs, and the ‘post-human,’ automation and surveillance, democracy and digital activism.","Whitney,Tyler",AMCULT,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Politics of Code,"This course will allow students to think through the concept of “code” from several vantage points, focusing particularly on how codes carry politics and how politics determine and define relationships of power. Code, as we will see, can be based on a wide variety of phenomena, from coding as categorization, to coding as passwords, to coding as computer programming languages and software. These varied understandings of what code can make us consider how exactly code can have politics, and how that politics might interact with—and determine— our daily lives.

History of American Radicalism,"This course offers a general history of radical, left-wing movements in the United States that were intended to challenge varied forms of inequality, domination, exploitation, or violence and to foster some kind of emancipatory reconstruction of American life and government. With some attention to early forms of artisans´ and workingmen´s radicalism, as well as the antebellum abolitionist and women´s rights movement, we will focus on the development and the fate of a modern Left — from the labor, anarchist, socialist, and communist movements through the Black freedom struggle and the New Left of the 1960s, feminism, gay liberation, union democracy movements and beyond. We will try to understand the aspirations and ideas, forms of organization and activism, dilemmas and weaknesses, relations to mainstream politics and repressive authority, successes and failures in each of these cases. 
	
The course will conclude with a study of radicalism in the late 20th century and early 21st century: women´s, environmentalist, antiwar, and queer activism of the 1980s; the organization of street protests in response to ""globalization,"" signaled dramatically in the “Battle of Seattle” of late 1999; and the advent of “Occupy Wall Street” in the global “year of the protester,” 2011.

South Asian Diaspora in America,"In recent years, South Asian Americans have become an increasingly visible presence in American popular culture, as writers and characters on TV shows, stand-up comics, and most recently, the winners of Spelling Bees and Miss America Pageants. Such narratives have filled a convenient script for the “model minority” myth of the U.S., while troublingly glossing over reports that are far more dissonant with narratives of the American dream. Instances of racism and xenophobia against South Asian enclaves have occurred in the 1980s, while racial profiling and violence against South Asians, particularly Sikhs and Muslims, by state and non-state actors spiked after 9/11. But for more than a century, South Asians have played a key role in North American history, at the center of legal and historical cases that changed the parameters of race and citizenship in the U.S. and Canada. This course will explore this long history — from the earliest settlers who arrived in the late nineteenth century to the effects of the ""War on Terror.""

We will also consider how writers, filmmakers, and other artists have explored the experiences of diaspora and immigration, and the complex racial and gender politics of the U.S, through a series of guiding questions:

1.) What are the limits and possibilities of the category “South Asian American”?
2.) How have South Asians fit into and shaped the racial politics of the U.S.? And how do they overlap with the social categories of caste and religion?
3.) What kind of stereotypes have been constructed around South Asian people over the course of U.S. history? And how have South Asian Americans responded?
4.) How have South Asians organized communities in America? How have they been received by and how have they remade American society?","Desai,Manan R",AMCULT,359,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Sex and Sexuality in U.S. Popular Culture,"We will explore how changing ideas about sex, sexuality, and gender appeared in certain types of twentieth-century popular culture. As a group, we will learn to interpret media, such as movies or television, as historical texts that provide insight into past notions about sex in the United States. To this end, we will start with the assumption that media functions as mechanisms of socialization and as a venue for expressing popular concerns or beliefs about gender roles, same-sex desire, race, and so forth. We will uncover how the media represented historical issues such as courtship among heterosexuals, pornography, gay liberation, and birth control through a weekly film lab. At the same time, we will seek to uncover the voices of groups that the mainstream media have often omitted (or actively sought to silence) in discussions about sex. To that end, much of our course reading will draw from academics engaged in an assortment of overlapping fields. Students will be introduced to scholarship in race and ethnic studies, queer studies, feminist studies, and so forth.

"Sex and Gender in U.S. History, 1600-2015","Beginning in seventeenth-century British America, this course will focus upon the experiences of American women--black and white, native and settler--from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. We will explore the family structure, gender expectations, and cultural practices. We will look closely at intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and class and the role they play in the development of self-identity.  The changing concepts of equality and difference, as employed by women and men in articulating gender relations, will serve as a theoretical framework for our examination.","Kelley,Mary C",AMCULT,371,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
History of the U.S. West,"
 

Ecological zones as distinct as the Great Plains, Southwestern deserts, and the Pacific coast all fall into the region known today as the U.S. West. We might ask, how could it be that such divergent places would come to be conceived as a unified region? How, too, has the “West” come to hold such a critical place in the imagining of the United States' past and present? We might start to answer those questions by acknowledging that naming the region as the “West” has been only the most recent effort to understand these lands. Diverse populations, empires, and nations have at various moments thought of those same places as their “South”, their “North”, or their “East.” Whatever they called it, all of them thought of it as theirs. We will think through these shifting claims by considering diverse perspectives including Native Americans, Europeans, Latina/os, Asians, and Euro Americans as they appeared from 1200 CE to the present. Through that expansive span of time, we will learn, these plains, deserts, and mountains witnessed remarkable cross-cultural exchanges, celebrations, and great sorrows.","Mora,Anthony P",AMCULT,373,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"The Politics and Culture of the ""Sixties""","Civil Rights, Vietnam, Women’s Rights, Black Power, Brown Power, and campus activism. Rock ‘n’ Roll, Motown, The Graduate, Woodstock, and Hippies.  The 1960s staged some of the most transformative political and cultural developments in American history. This course examines the 1960s as a series of cultural and political battles in which various groups fought over what it means to be an American. We’ll consider the political battles that were waged from the early days of the civil rights movement to the activism on college campuses to the resignation of Richard Nixon.  We’ll also consider the cultural battles from the youth culture and Black culture origins of rock ‘n’ roll to the impact of musicians such as Nina Simone and the Beatles to the emergence of a counterculture. Along the way, with a focus on race, ethnicity, and gender, we will pay close attention to those who mobilized for social, political, and cultural change and to those who mobilized in defense of the status quo.

Studies in Transnational Media,"Narcotrafficking and the U.S./Mexico border have remained at the center of political and cultural debate in the United States for over three decades. These topics have also become staples of the contemporary mediascape, from journalistic reporting to horror films and streaming content. The point of departure for this course is the documentary series The Day I Met El Chapo, which is representative of Netflix’s heavy reliance on narcotrafficking for various genres of programming. The course is intended to provide a historical and media industrial context for the recent explosion of such productions, including the creation and distribution of media between the U.S. and Latin America; narco cinema and the Mexican film industry; gender, class, race, and transnational stardom; visualizations of the U.S/Mexico border; drug trafficking narratives; the history of Latina/o media representation; the historical and contemporary immigration debate; and the digital and industrial landscape that has fostered the proliferation of narco-related content. By returning to The Day I Met El Chapo as a touchstone over the course of the semester, the course is also intended to give students the experience and skill set required to analyze a single media text from multiple perspectives.","Gunckel,Colin",AMCULT,380,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Day I Met El Chapo,3,,,"Prior coursework in Film Television, and Media, Communications (TV), or Latino Studies.

Latinas/Latinos and the Media,"From immigration debates to Emmy-winning television, Latina/os are a prevalent yet often misunderstood fixture of our contemporary mediascape. The course examines the ongoing presence and participation of Latina/os in the U.S. media from both a historical and contemporary perspective. Examining the relationships between socio-historical contexts, images, and industry discourse, we will also consider the intertwined questions of race, nation, gender, and stereotype through case studies of individual stars, from Carmen Miranda to Sofia Vergara. While analyzing representations of Latina/os in mainstream film and television, the course also considers the broad range of media through which Latina/os have represented themselves: experimental film, documentary, the alternative press, social media, and music cultures. Through this survey of cultural production, students will become versed in histories of immigration, various modes of media activism, the relation of Latina/os to conceptions of race, the diverse experiences of different national origin groups, and contemporary issues facing this population.","Gunckel,Colin",AMCULT,381,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.

Islamophobia,"Islamophobia is rising in action, debate, and discussion.  Not without controversy, its structural history and intersectional presence across a range of identities – all connected to Islam or Muslims - has led to Islam’s increased racialization in a variety of spaces including the media, the academy, the law, and more.  While the semantic currency of the term Islamophobia itself may be debated by scholars invested in the topic, the substance behind the term and the merits of teaching it are far less controversial among them.  Instead, some scholars have shifted to a less problematic “anti-Muslim bias” description in substitute for the more vernacular, Islamophobia.  The idea with the shift in terminology, and with this course, is to move beyond understanding discrimination and prejudice against Muslims as a result of personal limitations (Muslims are marginalized because no one knows them or because Islam is misunderstood, etc.), to include the critical influence of historical, structural, and systemic bias and discrimination of Muslims that is a key contributor to the rampant Islamophobia present today.","Khalil,Nancy",AMCULT,384,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Not a Phobia: Racializing Islam & Anti-Muslim Bias,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
History of American Jews,"Jews today are one of the most visible minorities in the United States: college educated, high income, steadfast supporters of the Democratic party. But it wasn’t always this way. How did a poor immigrant group become American and how did they manage to stay Jewish at the same time? This course explores a series of overlapping questions. How should American Jews be understood: As an American minority group? a dissenting non-Christian religious group? an immigrant and ethnic group? as a privileged white group? a cultural group? Employing the visual and aural dimensions of Jewish culture, including film, photography, music, and television along with readings in original documents and historical texts, the course suggests that studying American Jews challenges accepted interpretations of American history. Why for example, does the Jewish American poet Emma Lazarus’s sonnet “The New Colossus” adorn the Statue of Liberty? Why did the deaths of so many Jewish and Italian working women in Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire dramatically change labor laws in the U.S.?","Dash Moore, Deborah  ",AMCULT,387,"Fall 2021, ",Section 101,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in American Culture,"Integration was central to both the theories and practices of mid-twentieth-century American race relations. This course brings together content and methods from dance studies and performance studies to consider responses to integration, from landmark civil rights legal decisions to social and art movements that questioned mainstream understandings of integrations' potential denial of racial difference. The course will be anchored in key examples drawn from American dance from 1930-1970, but will also include the study of complementary performances in theatre and musical theatre. The course will develop students' performance analysis skills through close readings of choreographic works, plays, and librettos, as well as introducing students to performance studies' approaches appropriate for considering embodied forms of public engagement, including civil rights protests and political speeches, as performance. Interweaving dance and performance studies in a final writing project will provide undergraduate students with a dance-specific paper appropriate for application to graduate programs in dance studies and performance studies. The class will also provide historical and theoretical concepts students can deploy in their work as artists and as critically-engaged audience members.

Each class will focus on the history, theory and practice of different media technology, including photography, film, sound art, video and television art, and other telecommunications platforms. In addition to studying key episodes where the history of these media intersected with colonial projects or Indigenous resistance, we will analyze core theoretical positions on media studies from the fields of Indigenous futurisms, cybernetics, and the materialist discipline known as media archaeology. Along the way, we will consider such fundamental questions as: How and why do we differentiate tool from technology, a technology from the medium? What are the racialized, gendered or primitivizing implications of these distinctions? How has technologically-aided representation been weaponized against Indigenous sovereignty, and how might media become sympathetic allies?

Made in Detroit: A History of Art and Culture in the Motor City,"The embodiment of ""Modern Times"" was the assembly line and Detroit, dubbed ""the capital of the Twentieth Century"" played an important symbolic role in the modern imagination. Yet while artists depicted Detroit's industry as an abstract emblem of twentieth-century progress— and later of dystopian decline— the city has complicated labor, racial, and political history that its art, architecture, and urban planning help us to question. This seminar examines how Detroit has been presented in art and the role that the arts and architecture have played in the city from the 1880s to the present. We will consider both works produced in Detroit that defined a technological future and urban culture for the world and those that have particular local histories, from the sleek factories that heralded modern architecture in America to the artificial past that Henry Ford assembled at Greenfield Village, from the heroic worker figures of Diego Rivera's murals to the controversies surrounding the Joe Louis monument and street art, from ""ruin porn"" and gentrification to prospects for the future. This year we will devote extra attention to researching Detroit arts during the rise of the Black Power movement, through the 1967 rebellion or riot and into the city's emergence as a majority-Black metropolis.","Zurier,Rebecca",AMCULT,433,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"Upperclass standing; prior coursework in Art History, U.S. History, American Culture, or Urban studies, and permission of instructor.",,May not be repeated for credit.,

Capstone Seminar in American Culture,"The age-old saying, “beauty is only skin deep,” tells us that physical attractiveness does not account for more meaningful qualities like character, intelligence, and goodness. But throughout American history, “beauty” has been used as a proxy to determine racial differences and at the same time, to ascertain those more meaningful personal characteristics. Throughout this course, we will examine the various ways in which Americans have used determinants of beauty (e.g., body size, skin color, height, musculature, hair texture, facial symmetry, etc.) to racialize and subsequently, rank and place value on people. Starting with Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) and ending with current-day discussions of beauty and race (e.g., the Kardashians, racial discrimination in online dating), the course will cover several topics including the black is beautiful movement, pageants, interracial dating, colorism, and debates over cultural appropriation.","Purkiss, Ava  ",AMCULT,498,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Skin Deep: Race and Beauty in American Culture,4,ULWR,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

The Archaeology of Early Humans,"This course explores humanity’s most ancient roots. From the very earliest toolmakers to people physically and behaviorally identical to ourselves, the emergence of human culture is charted using archaeological evidence. After a firm theoretical, chronological, and climatic introduction, we begin in Africa some 3 million years ago when powerful evolutionary forces promoted new ways of living, thinking, and interacting. We then track the dynamic biological and behavioral changes that culminated in the emergence of our own species, Homo sapiens, and trace our unprecedented spread to every habitable corner of the Earth. We finish with the major transformations of economy and society that came with the advent of plant and animal domestication around 12,000 years ago. Along the way, we will encounter key milestones in human history, including technological innovations in stone, bone, wood, and clay; the harnessing of fire and invention of cooking; the emergence of big game hunting, fishing, trapping, and snaring; the colonization of dangerous environments like deserts and the high arctic; the earliest seafaring; the development of strategies for coping with climate change; and the origins of symbolism, religion, music, and art. We will also review evidence for ancient interactions between our species and our more archaic contemporaries, the Neanderthals, Hobbits, and Denisovans. With this course, students will gain a solid understanding of the major players and events of deep human history, situated within a robust framework of evolutionary theory. Students will also have opportunities to handle real archaeological artifacts from the periods being discussed.","Stewart,Brian A",ANTHRARC,385,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,Sophomore standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Anthropological Archaeology,"This graduate-level course explores the human relationship with risk an evolutionary perspective. The development of enhanced biocultural mechanisms for hedging against diverse uncertainties was a long-term process that unfolded across an increasingly volatile Pleistocene epoch, a process leading ultimately to previously unseen levels of behavioral elasticity and socioecological coupling. Perhaps the most spectacular symptom of this was the global dispersion of our own species, Homo sapiens, and our subsequent cultural diversification. The course uses this phased macroevolutionary process as an inspiration for its structure, charting deep-time human entanglements with a range of so-called “hard habitats” – deserts, rainforests, mountains, circumpolar regions, and oceans. Cognitive, technological, logistical, social, and ritual dimensions of the adaptive resilience that developed in each biome type are explored through salient archaeological and ethnographic case studies drawn from throughout the world.","Stewart,Brian A",ANTHRARC,482,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - The Archaeology of Risk and Resilience,3,,,Junior standing.,,May be elected twice for credit.

First Year Seminar: Searching for Human Origins,"Understanding our origin has long been an agenda of philosophers, theologians, anatomists, and naturalists, and early theories generated were rooted primarily in conceptual frameworks. Speculation was the dominant theme of these narratives. The discovery and systematic study of human fossils is a recent phenomenon and the wealth of fossil data that has been collected, especially during the last 40 years has revolutionized our perspectives of our origins and the processes involved in the evolution of the human lineage. While major questions have been answered, many still remain, and contemporary scientific explanations continue to be influenced by preconceptions and traditional views. 

In this course, we will examine how the fossil record has reshaped our understanding of our evolution during the last 6 million years, philosophical, theoretical and analytical dimensions of these scientific inquiries, and major controversies which have been played out in interpretations of the data collected primarily from the East and South African fossil records.


This course

 Combines reading material and discussions that traverse many disciplines within the natural sciences. 
 Provides a comprehensive introductory examination of eclectic topics that relate to biological anthropology, psychology, evolutionary theory, and paleontology utilizing a rigorous scientific approach. 
 emphasizes critical evaluation of observations, experiments, formation of testable hypotheses about natural phenomena related to human origins, and testing of those hypotheses.

It will also address how environmental and cultural variation interacts to produce differences between modern human populations.","Devlin, Maureen J",ANTHRBIO,201,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Human Evolution,"Human evolution has been a biological process with both social and physical aspects. Through lectures, discussion section, laboratory, and reading, we will examine the fossil evidence for human evolution, emphasizing both the details of skeletal anatomy and behavior and how they changed, and the causes of change.  How are humans unique, how are they similar to other primates, does race play a role in human evolution?  The human story begins with origins and the appearance of unique human anatomies and behaviors.  Humanity has come to be defined by the evolution of intelligence, technology, and the changes in physical form that are the consequence of the human adaptation to the culture that links cultural and biological change. We will also discuss the role of Neandertals in human evolution, ""out of Africa"", race and racism, and other questions about the origin of modern humanity. Class participation and discussion are emphasized, and there is a required discussion/ laboratory section for the elaboration of lecture topics and experience with primate skeletal material and replicas of human fossils through online lab sections with the GSI.

It will cover important aspects of their life histories, their social systems, and their reproduction, such as dominance and aggression, mating and parenting, predation, feeding strategies, and social relationships. Part 2 will focus on primate cognition, including their communication and problem-solving abilities and their analogs of culture. The class will draw heavily on field studies of primates, and emphasize their behavior in natural environmental and social settings.","Rosenbaum,Stacy",ANTHRBIO,368,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, BS, NS",,,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,
U.G. Reading and Research in Anthropology,"Laboratory training and work in the techniques used in various aspects of research in biological anthropology.

ANTHRBIO 370 is designed to provide students with an opportunity to work closely with a professor over the span of a single semester on a research question in biological anthropology. Ideally, it should be undertaken after the student has been exposed to one or more 300-level course in the subfield. The course can serve as a stepping stone for juniors considering an honors thesis, or for juniors or seniors who want a single semester, one-on-one research experience with a professor. 

 ANTHRBIO 370 fulfills the important function of allowing students to more deeply investigate a particular research topic than is typically possible in lecture and lab-based courses. Students will identify a question of interest and review, synthesize and interpret existing literature on the question. In some cases, they will also engage in primary research related to that question, supervised by their professor.Course Requirements:	Student will have bi-weekly written assignments and a final research paper.Intended Audience:Advanced undergraduates.Class Format:Student will meet with Professor at least bi-weekly, depending on the stage of the research.",,ANTHRBIO,370,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,1 - 3,,Independent,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,With permission of instructor.

Humans and Environmental Change,"Utilizing an ecological perspective, we will address basic questions of why and how humans evolved over the past seven million years. What were the adaptive forces that our ancestors faced and how has this shaped who we are today? To pursue these concepts, we need to adopt a multidisciplinary perspective, drawing from fields as diverse as anthropology, evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, paleontology, geology, physiology, climatology, and psychology. Initially, this will involve a scrutiny of biotic and abiotic factors that may have influenced early human evolution including local and regional environmental/climatic change, associated faunal and floral communities, habitat and dietary reconstructions, seasonality and foraging strategies, tool manufacture and use, the transition into a glacial world characterized by constantly shifting climates, and potential geographic and ecological barriers controlling the dispersal of early humans. While retaining a broad perspective, we will focus on some of the key evolutionary stages in human evolution, ultimately including the extent to which ecology can be linked to the evolution and development of social structures and the capacity for culture in modern humans.","Kingston,John",ANTHRBIO,373,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"BS, NS",,ANTHRBIO 201.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Biological Anthropology,"In this course, we will consider the relationship between human evolutionary biology and modern health and disease. The environments in which we live are dramatically different from those in which our ancestors evolved. Does this mismatch influence our susceptibility to metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and diseases of aging such as arthritis and osteoporosis? Can we use evolutionary thinking to improve modern human health and wellbeing? To address these questions, this course will review the principles of evolutionary biology; discuss how the major transitions in human evolution have influenced our anatomy and physiology; and consider how interactions between our biology and the modern environment, including agriculture and industrialization, affect human health. Students will develop a research project investigating a modern human health condition from an evolutionary perspective.","Devlin, Maureen J",ANTHRBIO,469,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Human Evolution and Human Health,2,BS,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Introduction to Anthropology,"This course introduces students to anthropology and its four subdisciplines (archaeological, biological, cultural, and linguistic anthropology), providing a glimpse of the field's history, present status, and importance. We'll look at the concepts and methods that typify the discipline and frame anthropology's comprehensive, holistic worldview. The course looks especially at cultural and ethnic diversity, and the interactions leading to structures of dominance, inequality, and resistance. It teaches students ways of learning and thinking about the world's many designs for living in time and space. We'll cover topics like the nature of culture, race and ethnicity; human genetics, biological evolution, and the fossil record; primate (monkey and ape) behavior; the emergence of agriculture, cities, and states; language and culture; systems of marriage, kinship, and family; sex-gender divisions; economics, politics, and religion in global perspective; theories of development, power and social change; technoscience and emerging media; world systems, global assemblages, and contemporary cultural predicaments. *Please note there is a special discussion section of Anthropology 101 this semester that will focus in particular on activities and discussions informed by dialogic pedagogy:[Section .011] This section is of interest to students who would like to explore topics of social identity and social justice in more depth, making connections between course content and current conversations around issues of race and ethnicity in a smaller discussion-based setting.

The Comparative Study of Cultures,"Why do people do things in different ways? Why do they sometimes understand and value the things they do so differently? What do these cultural differences mean? What are the ways in which we think about and understand difference? How can we think about and understand cultural change and the meaning of cultures in a world where people and societies constantly collide and commingle? This course has two aims: first, to introduce students to the concept of culture and to a small sampling of the great diversity of cultures that exist around the world; second, to learn about some approaches to understanding this cultural diversity—and, along the way, to learn a bit of the history of social and anthropological theory. 

Classes will be organized around the discussion of readings and materials that span several cultures and diverse approaches to studying, thinking about, and describing culture, from ethnographic accounts (both classic and recent), to theoretical statements, to fictional writing and documentary film.

"Crime, Criminalization and Punishment","We live in a society that relies heavily on policing, surveillance, imprisonment, and other methods of control to address a range of social, political, and economic problems. This reliance has devastating impacts for those directly targeted, as well as their families and communities and plays a major role in reproducing inequalities based on race, gender, and social position. Using the United States as a primary case study, this course draws from anthropology’s best contributions to the topic, as well as a range of critical theoretical perspectives in order to closely examine the processes, systems, and institutions through which certain groups of people come to be seen as criminal, criminalized and punished. Simultaneously, the course charts and analyzes the possibilities and politics of change.","Burch,Melissa",ANTHRCUL,235,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
The Anthropology of Food,"Do you eat to live, or live to eat? If the latter, this course may be for you. As anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss wrote, the plants and animals around us are not just good to eat, they are good to think with and through. Anthropologists study the human condition in all its forms, including how we evolved as a species, how we communicate, how we lived in the historic and prehistoric past, and how we organize our lives in different parts of the world today. In the realm of food, we thus pay close attention to the ways in which humans hunt, fish, gather, and grow food, how we get enough calories to survive in differing environments, how food helps us to constitute families, religious identities, and other social networks, and even how food comes to be a source and a symptom of social inequality. We will address all of these issues, as well as the symbolic uses and meanings of food in sacred and everyday contexts.
Students read articles and chapters that are the result of all of the listed methods, and they evaluate which ones are most effective at making different sorts of arguments. Students are also introduced to readings from history, neuroscience, and human geography, allowing them to see different ways that the study of human culture and society draws sociocultural anthropologists into conversation with people working in other anthropological subfields and neighboring disciplines.","McGovern, Mike  ",ANTHRCUL,254,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Cuba and its Diaspora,"This course examines Cuban history, literature, and culture since the Revolution, both on the island and in the United States diaspora. In political and cultural essays, personal narratives, fiction, poetry, drama, visual art, music, and film, we will seek a comprehensive and diverse view of how Cubans on the island and Cubans in the diaspora understand their situation as people of the same nation divided for fifty years by the Cold War, revolution, and exile. Topics to be considered include the meaning of diasporas in our time, Fidel Castro and the making of the Cuban Revolution, masculinity and gay sexuality in the Revolution and Cuban diaspora, women's dreams, everyday life under communism, Afrocuban culture and religion, Jewish-Cuban revitalization, the Cuban visual arts movement, and the construction and deconstruction of exile identity.","Behar,Ruth",ANTHRCUL,314,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Issues in Race & Ethnicity,3,"SS, RE",,,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Critical Theory in Medicine and Healing,"This writing intensive lecture course introduces upper division undergraduates to the critical anthropological analysis of illness, health, healing and medicine.  Our investigation will be comparative, examining how different systems of meaning and power make sense of bodily states, historically and cross-culturally.  We will explore current and past medical anthropological approaches — political economic, symbolic, feminist, post-structuralist — in order to critically evaluate how well these frameworks convey the lived experience of bodies in their local worlds.  The intellectual excitement of medical anthropology comes from its ability to challenge categories and boundaries that seem natural and fixed.  Ultimately, my goal is for students to think differently about the embodied relations of health and affliction as produced through the natural ""order of things"".","Roberts,Elizabeth FS",ANTHRCUL,327,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, SS",,One course in ANTHRCUL or RCSSCI or WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240) or WGS (WOMENSTD) with an SS designation.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Globalizing Consumer Cultures,"In this course, ""consumer culture"" will be placed in the context of the political and economic changes that have attended globalization, including widening social inequalities and the rise of global standards for middle-class respectability.  Drawing on anthropological approaches to economic exchange and material culture, we will cover how consumer goods can materialize social relations, redefine local and national identities, and confuse consumption with citizenship. We will also examine the role of advertising, branding, and the power of multinational corporations to influence local practices in places as diverse as Hungary, Vietnam, the United States, Sweden, and Nepal.  Students will complete the course with an ethnographic project.","Fehervary,Krisztina E",ANTHRCUL,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
"Culture, Thought, and Meaning","This course is an intensive, upper-division Introduction to Cultural Anthropology and Cultural Studies. Concentrators and non-concentrators are welcome; the course is closed to first-year students.  This course is about ideas anthropologists have developed to understand human differences and human relationships, from the end of the nineteenth century to the present day. How does anthropology teach us to think about the difference at the sources of human, meta-human, animal, cyborg, and other forms of life? The goal of the course is to show how ethnographic inquiry is a unique and powerful form of thinking, which has developed its own modes of understanding the complexities of social lives in our contemporary world. We explore a rich variety of texts in from different historical periods and regions, including Papua New Guinea, Bali, and the US. Students will develop a basic understanding of some theoretical problems in cultural anthropology, a set of tools for analyzing cultural phenomena, and a stronger appreciation of difference in all its forms. Students will strengthen their analytical skills by learning: (1) to understand and articulate essential arguments and concepts in readings; (2) to trace conceptual relations among readings as a step towards understanding basic theoretical problems in anthropology; and (3) to understand how anthropological theories provide insight into the contemporary world This course fulfills the Upper-Level Writing Requirement.","Mueggler,Erik A",ANTHRCUL,330,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, HU",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
The Globalization of Biomedicine,"When people say “global health,” they usually mean delivering Western medicine in low-resource settings. This assumes that medicine is a universal good. Is it? Or is biomedicine also a “culture” – with values, practices, and understandings built in a particular place and time? What are medicine’s ethics, symbols, economies, experiences of the body, and politics? What happens when these things run up against other ways of viewing the world? In this course, through scholarship and popular media, and through the instructor’s experiences as a practicing physician and anthropologist, we will explore mind-bending paradoxes about what we assume to be true, explore aspects of medical practice, and describe why those practices often have unexpected results when they travel.","Stonington,Scott",ANTHRCUL,341,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Latin America: The Colonial Period,"

This course introduces the early period of Latin American history. We begin by exploring Amerindian civilizations on the eve of European arrival in the Americas, before turning to the Iberian Peninsula in the years leading up and through Spanish and Portuguese expansion. We study interactions among Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans, and the emergence of multi-ethnic societies, political and religious cultures in what might most accurately be called a New World for all. Primary sources – both texts and images – are our principal points of entry for understanding colonial systems, work regimes, tensions and conflicts, and evolving identities within “colonial Latin America.” Our focus extends into late eighteenth-century when a variety of struggles and rebellions across the region anticipated independence movements in the early nineteenth century.

Topics in Sociocultural Anthropology,"This course is a rare opportunity to engage Detroit simultaneously from theoretical and practical perspectives, from the perspectives of music history, social history, architectural history, cultural anthropology, literature, and film… We will read, we will write, and we will learn how to make films with the help of an award-winning filmmaker from Berlin. We will approach Detroit from the perspectives of race, gender, sexuality, democracy, urbanization, suburbanization, industrialization, de-industrialization, emergency management, and the future. In thinking about the future, we will think about the extent to which Detroit is representative of American and other urban futures, and to what extent is the exception. We will also examine Detroit's place in the world. How does it compare to Mumbai in India, Johannesburg in South Africa, and how does it compare to Berlin in Europe? Finally, we will work with a group of young people who live in and are growing up in Detroit. We will learn not only how to see Detroit from their perspectives, but also how to collectively produce films about it.

Seminar in Sociocultural Anthropology,"This course investigates human relations through sound, with a particular focus on the role of sound in mediating social life. We will analyze the categories of sound, music, and noise (and silence) in a variety of cultural and historical contexts, paying attention to how these categories change over space and time. Topics include, but are not limited to, the sounds of protest, audio reproduction technologies, noise control engineering, and public and private space. An exploration of how people, animals, and technological objects communicate through sound and sounding practices will further allow us to consider auditory perception as a social phenomenon in addition to a personal experience. Class activities include making audio recordings, going on soundwalks, and making a soundmap. These activities will be completed alongside readings in acoustic ecology, the anthropology of sound, media and communication studies, and musicology.","Hsieh, Jennifer C",ANTHRCUL,357,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Sound, Music, and Noise",3,SS,,A course in cultural anthropology and junior standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Language and Culture,"While languages and cultures have each been described as tight systems of meaningful coherence that reinforce each other, communication in social life is more slippery than that, rife with contradictions and conflicts.  People, for instance, may justify hierarchies by referring to linguistic or cultural standards even when doctors or CEOs themselves speak “ungrammatically.”   This course surveys research and reflection on language as a part of ""culture,"" drawing on literature in anthropology, linguistics, and related fields.  Included are scholars who see culture as primarily cognitive (and relative) ways of ‘knowing’, such as how people conceive of categories like space and time, or how they classify people and things.  However, language is no innocent medium, it does not passively disclose facts about a preexisting social, cultural, and cognitive world, but rather helps to actively constitute, even transform our worlds.  We will pay attention to the ways languages and cultures shape our relationships and channel our choices. We will also attend to struggles over meanings and forms and contexts, and will attend not only to grammar and to sound, but also to alphabets and to screens, to slangs and slogans, to humor and to authority, to resistance and to history, to the making of misunderstandings. We explore these issues through classic and contemporary readings, and through examples culled from across the globe.","Keane, Webb  ",ANTHRCUL,374,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,Sophomore standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Anthropologies of Insurgency: Bandits, Rebels and Freedom Fighters","This course explores the interlinked categories of rebel, bandit, and freedom fighter to understand insurgency from an anthropological viewpoint.  Privileging sociological and micropolitical analysis, the course approaches specific instances of illegal use of force in their socio-cultural and historic settings, and builds toward a consideration of insurgency from “the actors’ points of view”.  Through the categories of the rebel, bandit, and insurgent, the course considers broader issues of structure and agency, state power and sovereignty, and definitions of legal and illegal uses of force from the oblique angle of those whose violence is classified as illegitimate.

Beginning with Marx and the problematic category of the lumpenproletariat, the course moves on to consider Hobsbawm’s analysis of banditry as well as his critics.  Moving forward, the class considers a series of case studies from Europe, West Africa, South and Southeast Asia, Southern Africa, and Central America, finishing with a consideration of contemporary insurgency in the Middle East and Afghanistan.  Rather than focus on strategic analysis of insurgency/counterinsurgency, this course will focus on questions of meaning and intentionality that go to the heart of how insurgents build (or sometimes destroy) the essential bonds between themselves and the wider groups on whose behalf they claim to fight.Course Requirements:The grade will be based on class participation (33%) and on the final paper or project (66%).  Readings will be modest, and it is expected that students will have done all of the reading for each meeting.  It is the responsibility of each student to demonstrate her or his mastery of the readings during class sessions, and failure to do so will result in a lower grade for participation.Intended Audience:The course will be offered to graduate students and upper level undergraduate anthropology majors with the permission of the instructor.

Topics in Sociocultural and Linguistic Anthropology,"In recent years, the Asia-Pacific region has become home to a majority urban population. The rapid growth of Asian cities has created new challenges in terms of housing, environmental sustainability, and infrastructure development. This course investigates the social, political, environmental, economic, and technological transformations in densely-populated urban centers, with a particular focus on East and Southeast Asia. Taking the city as a unit of analysis, the course asks, in what ways do cities function beyond the nation state? What forms of regional and transnational exchange emerge out of urban networks? How do cities confront the challenges of urban life, particularly with regards to climate change, infrastructure repair, gentrification, and social inequality? Starting with an examination of Asian cities, including their form and governance, the course continues with a comparative study of urban life, focusing on the role of various urban actors, such as local officials, activists, artists, laborers, pedestrians, and engineers, in the creation of livable cities. Students will develop an understanding of the unique features and challenges of urbanization and urban life in twenty-first century Asia. Course texts will draw from anthropology, Asian studies, environmental studies, geography, history, and urban planning.","Hsieh, Jennifer C",ANTHRCUL,458,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Urban Asia in the Twenty-First Century,3,,,Junior and above.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Nonverbal Communication,"How do our bodies express, or betray, what we mean when we talk with others?  In this introduction to the study of embodied communication, we explore the hidden dimensions of conversation by working closely with video recordings. We look at gesture, gaze, nods, demeanor, and posture; how people manage their bodies in small groups and navigate the built environment. We look at the way small nonverbal behaviors can matter for big social issues like gender politics, everyday racism, socioeconomic class stratification, and religious and cultural difference.  Although you’ll read literature every week, the course is hands-on and designed to sharpen your skills in observation and analysis. For much of the semester, you’ll use multimedia software to look at different things in the same short stretch of video data, which you record yourself or capture from online sources.","Lempert,Michael Paul",ANTHRCUL,476,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Body Talk, Body Politics",3,,,One course in anthropology or linguistics.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Honors in Sociocultural and Linguistic Anthropology,"This honors course sequence in cultural anthropology is designed for undergraduate anthropology concentrators who are specializing in cultural anthropology and have applied for senior Honors in the Department of Anthropology.  This course is divided into two parts.  In the Fall Term, the students will meet once a week in seminar to read and discuss a selection of significant monographs and papers in ethnology, and a selection of writings on fieldwork methods and research strategies in ethnology.  This seminar provides background for the students to define their own senior Honors thesis project.  By the end of the term, the students will have decided on a project, and begun preliminary work on it.  In consultation with the honors advisor the student may request any member of the Anthropology Department to serve as a main thesis advisor or second reader.  In the Winter Term, the students will convene periodically in seminar with the Honors advisor to discuss their research projects and get feedback from the group, as well as staying in contact with the honors advisor and second reader.  By the end of the term, each student should have completed the research and write-up for their thesis so that they can make a formal summary presentation of it for the group.

First Year Seminar in Arab American Studies,"#RepresentationMatters has become a popular hashtag and saying but why? What is the impact of what we see in the media on how we view others and ourselves? This course explores that question by looking at two stigmatized groups, Black Americans and American Muslims, and how they are represented in US popular culture. We will examine and compare stereotypical representations of these groups on TV and in film and the roles these stereotypes play in shaping what the American public “knows” about Black people and about Muslims. In this course, students are introduced to important concepts of popular culture and the skills to interpret music, film, and television so they learn to look critically at the relationship between race, religion, and popular culture. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify and analyze popular culture’s explicit and implicit uses of race and religion, have a solid knowledge of theories on media and representation and be capable of making their own cultural critique.","Abdul Khabeer,Su'ad",ARABAM,103,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Race, Religion, and Representation",3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Arab-American Studies,"Students will explore questions such as: What are the historical circumstances that have shaped Arab immigration to the U.S.? Where do Arab Americans “fit” within the U.S.' racial classification system? What is anti-Arab racism? How has it shifted throughout Arab American history? How did September 11th impact Arab American communities? What are the cultural forms that Arab immigrants have inherited from their homelands and reproduced in the U.S.? What is the relationship between socioeconomic class and cultural identity among Arab Americans? How have Arab Americans used the arts for cultural and political expression? What is the significance of religious affiliation to Arab American identity formation? How has U.S. foreign policy impacted Arab American histories and experiences? This course explores questions such as these in an interdisciplinary context, focusing on anthropological, historical & literary materials.

Introduction to American Muslims,"This undergraduate course teaches major events, fields, and debates that continue to shape American Muslim attitudes, priorities, inequalities, and interactions.  It covers a brief history of Muslims in the USA beginning with the European conquest of the Americas through the present time.  From media to fashion, sports to politics, medicine to commerce, stigma to discrimination, or race to sect, the course incorporates a variety of voices frequently positioned as representative of “Muslim Americans” along with the critical issues and arguments in the field of Muslim American Studies.  Beyond the depth and breadth of topic area knowledge, through this course, students will gain critical research, writing, and presentations skills that will benefit them regardless of their primary concentration.","Khalil,Nancy",ARABAM,216,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Islamophobia,"Islamophobia is rising in action, debate, and discussion.  Not without controversy, its structural history and intersectional presence across a range of identities – all connected to Islam or Muslims - has led to Islam’s increased racialization in a variety of spaces including the media, the academy, the law, and more.  While the semantic currency of the term Islamophobia itself may be debated by scholars invested in the topic, the substance behind the term and the merits of teaching it are far less controversial among them.  Instead, some scholars have shifted to a less problematic “anti-Muslim bias” description in substitute for the more vernacular, Islamophobia.  The idea with the shift in terminology, and with this course, is to move beyond understanding discrimination and prejudice against Muslims as a result of personal limitations (Muslims are marginalized because no one knows them or because Islam is misunderstood, etc.), to include the critical influence of historical, structural, and systemic bias and discrimination of Muslims that is a key contributor to the rampant Islamophobia present today.","Khalil,Nancy",ARABAM,384,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Not a Phobia: Racializing Islam & Anti-Muslim Bias,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.

Special Topics in Architecture,"Starting from the premise that race plays itself out visually, the course explores the relationship between art, materiality, space, and race. In addition to reading foundational literature in critical race studies including W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde, our inquiries will be grounded by five case studies: South Africa, Germany, India, Mexico, and the US. Each one of these cases will provide a conception of race rooted in local histories and cultures. By analyzing the visual and material dimensions of apartheid, antisemitism, xenophobia, slavery, and colonization through these case studies, we will articulate a multidimensional understanding of race as a historical concept. However, to ask how race has shaped visual culture also has global implications, as demonstrated by the recent removal of racists monuments across the world. Thus, by looking at each case study in comparison, students will develop an understanding of both the global and the local ramifications of racism and the antiracist movement. Objects, buildings, places, paintings, names, sculptures,s and public art will structure our weekly debates. Students will engage in visual analysis and independent research for their final assessment.","Rozas-Krause,Valentina Javiera",ARCH,409,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Visualizing Race Comparatively,3,,,UG ARCH STU.,,May be repeated for credit.,

The topic of this course — the role of death in Buddhism — stands alongside and in relation to other central aspects of the Buddhist tradition. Why death? From a certain perspective, conceptions and practices of dying, death, and the afterlife are the fundamental concerns of all Buddhists. How does the immanence of death influence the actions of the living? How should one die? What happens at the moment of death? What should be done with the bodies of the dead? Is there an afterlife? What is it that is reborn? We will explore these and other issues as they manifest in distinct cultural contexts (India, Thailand, China, and Japan) and as cross-cultural phenomena. In addition to assigned readings of scholarly articles and translations of primary texts, relevant topics will be addressed in class through lectures, discussions, numerous images, and films.","Brose,Benjamin",ASIAN,234,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Introduction to Asian Studies,"This course offers an introduction to Asian studies, the interdisciplinary field dedicated to understanding Asia through its complex and dynamic cultures, past and present. By learning about the history, religion, literature, politics, and popular culture of Asia, students will begin to see beyond commonplace perspectives and generalizations, gaining the skills to think in critical and informed ways about Asia and its place in the world. Students will learn to foreground Asian voices and perspectives in the study of Asian cultures, and they will reflect on the ways in which issues such as colonization, nation-building, and gender shape contemporary Asia and its many representations.

Seeds of Conflict: Intercultural Encounters in Japan from 745-1945,"Why are Japan’s relations with its neighbors so complicated today? How did these conflicts get started? Japan’s role in East Asia today—from its claims to disputed territories to its acknowledgment of wartime atrocities—is a sensitive subject for many. However, this is in part due to a complicated history that dates back to even before there was a Japan as such. To investigate how such tensions and conflicts emerged and developed over time, we make use of a variety of materials from the 8th century through WWII—history, literature, art, and film. Focusing on what these works reveal about how people understood (or wanted to understand) Japan’s relation to its neighbors, especially China, we will work towards a better understanding of forces and ideas that continue to influence relations between Japan and its neighbors today.","Brightwell, Erin L",ASIAN,244,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Introduction to Chinese Civilization,"This course is intended to introduce students to major issues in Chinese history from ancient times to the Chinese Revolution of 1949, with a specific focus on issues relating to race and ethnicity. In this connection, we investigate three problems:

China is often seen as a racially, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous society, but what is China and (Han) Chinese?
To what extent was the direction of Chinese civilization driven by contact with ethnic, religious, and cultural others? What role did ethnic, religious, and cultural conflict play in producing Chinese identity?
How did China transition from a multi-ethnic empire to a modern nation-state? To what extent was the creation of modern China a product of racial and ethnic strife?

 Readings and lectures will give equal weight to political and social developments, as well as to intellectual, religious, and cultural forces. There are no books or coursepacks for this course; all readings will be available through Canvas.Course Requirements:Course assignments will not only include reading primary and secondary literature (entirely in English), but also require students to analyze visual sources.

Students will deal with a wide variety of interrelated issues, such as conceptions of authority, skepticism, social equality, commitment to, or rejection of morality, etc. Some of the questions students will try to answer include:Is there a way of life that is best for humans or are we each unique in our needs and preferences? Should we try to improve the world or find contentment in all things as they are? What is the price of activism, and what is the price of apathy?","Ozbey,Sonya",ASIAN,263,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Looking at Traditional China Through its Most Famous Novel, The Story of the Stone","In this class, we will try together to get a better understanding of traditional Chinese culture by reading and discussing a novel that has both been praised as a veritable encyclopedia of Chinese life and mattered deeply to countless Chinese readers, some of whom read it year after year. Because the novel focuses on life within the household and the majority of its major characters are female, one of the foci of the course will be on the life of Chinese women during the time the novel was written. Class meetings will feature a number of different activities. One of these will be informal debates on specific topics. Topics to be debated can be the questions to think about indicated in the class schedule or may be chosen by the class. In the second half of the term, groups of three students (respectively taking the positions of pro, con, and judge) will also be asked to present to the class brief materials (articles, chapters from books) that they will read but the rest of the class will not. Finally, I may introduce topics for debate in a class by means of illustrations, overhead transparencies, or video material. The main goal of the various debates will be to permit us to get a wider and richer view of the novel and the culture that produced it, but we will also be interested in relating what we see in the novel to life around us and material we have learned in other contexts. The procedure of debating topics from different points of view will also help us be more critical about our own beliefs and predilections.","Rolston,David Lee",ASIAN,264,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Spectacular History of Korea: Visualizing Events,"What is a spectacular history?  Why do some events capture our imagination and end up on the front page of newspapers?  Why are some events more important in narrating history than others?  This course introduces students to the history of modern and contemporary Korea through events. Together, we will investigate the processes through which events that took place in twentieth-century Korea were rendered spectacular and consumed in the form of images and texts. Among other things, we will examine the tumultuous processes of Korea’s modernization, colonialism, wars, nation building, dissident movements, and the cold war, divisions. For each topic, we will choose an event, and take a close look at how it took place (history) and how it was represented in texts and visual media (spectacular history).  By looking at the processes through which experiences were transformed into spectacular images, we will not only try to gain a better perspective on the climate of the times but also on how representation and memory write history.

Topics in Asian Studies,"In popular culture, Buddhism is often associated with happiness. Can Buddhist ideas and praxis really make our lives happy? Or is it a marketing trope? Or, a modern invention? This course delves into Buddhist history, philosophy, and praxis by asking the arguably most important questions for life -- what is happiness and how we can be happy. Not only examining happiness as a mental or emotional status of the individual, this course also explores its relations to capitalism, state, modernity, and cross-cultural dynamics. It juxtaposes Buddhist canonical texts across traditions (Theravada, Chan/Zen, Pure Land, Esoteric, etc.) with works by influential contemporary Buddhist teachers, popular authors, and filmmakers, as well as consulting scholarly works regarding this topic.","Chen,Lang",ASIAN,280,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Can Buddhism Bring You Happiness?,3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.

South Asian Identity:  Writing Home from Away,"In this course, we will read 20th-century works of literary nonfiction by writers with South Asian links—the people write about a different place than they write from. This course encourages you to think about these issues first-hand with your own creative, as well as produce critical exercises in writing about place. We begin by comparing four short accounts of Mumbai/Bombay to see how narrative personality affects the portrait of a place, and then in subsequent weeks, develop a critical vocabulary for discussing these rhetorical decisions by having you talk about your own writing experiences, and pairing travel writing with travel theory. How do writers’ identities impact the way we construct a narrative “I” as our traveling selves and as our writing selves? What do we assume we have in common with our readers and what do we assume readers won’t share with us? What preconceptions of “here” and “there” (as “desh” and “videsh”) do we rely on to construct narrative authority? How is South Asian identity created in the diaspora?

This course emphasizes the honing of skills both in expository writing and in the close reading of literary texts. Special attention will be paid in both the reading and writing exercises to the special case of literary nonfiction, and how the creative and the critical elements necessarily come together in the ways we approach this genre.","Merrill she-her-hers, Christi  ",ASIAN,332,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

"Gender, Sexuality, and Power in Premodern China","This course explores gender and sexuality in China before the 20th century. Are “women” and “men” useful categories of analysis for premodern China, or did people think of themselves in other terms? What role did bodies, duties, virtues, and desires play in relationships among people? What role did writing play in negotiations of gender roles and expressions of sexual desire in premodern China? In this course, you will learn how gender and sexuality functioned in a range of premodern discourses and practices. We will begin by reading foundational Buddhist, Daoist, Confucian texts that prescribe gendered roles and virtues. We will bring these into conversation with the conception of the body and sex difference presented in traditional medical texts, which drew on all of these traditions. In the second part of the course, we will investigate the relationship between writing and gender, asking how people described gender and sexuality in letters, poetry, plays, novels, and short stories. We engage these experimental, utopian, or prescriptive gendered textual spaces with an interest to understand how people conceived of the delights and dangers, possibilities, and constraints of the negotiations between their bodies and texts. We will occasionally take our investigation beyond the textual realm to consider other sorts of objects: paintings, decorative objects, book illustrations, and theatrical performances. We will conclude by evaluating attacks on the traditional sex-gender system by feminist modernizing movements at the turn of the 20th century.","Rebull,Anne Elizabeth",ASIAN,352,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,At least one course in Asian studies or Women's studies.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

We will see how the “facts” of cases are proven and how the “motivation” of criminals is established in Chinese works. Attention will also be paid to how the Chinese legal system is represented as well as the broader question of the relationship of fictional literature and reality. The Chinese genres and subgenres of court case literature will be identified and compared with similar/related genres in the West (e.g., the picaresque novel, criminal biographies, crime fiction, the detective short story, and novel, “Judge Dee Novels,” etc.).

It has developed many genres and the film market there is poised to become the largest in the world. Yet how to watch a Chinese film and appreciate its various levels of significance remains an interesting, also challenging, question for viewers outside China. In this course, we will view a select list of contemporary films and examine how best to make sense of them. We will discuss how a film (from comedy to drama to martial arts to arthouse cinema) is shaped by the genre it belongs to and why watching a film from a different cultural context is always a rewarding as well as demanding experience.

We will ask how human activities and aspirations are inscribed onto the fabric of the city, and how the city is in turn utilized for social change and cultural expressions. We will examine the material space of the city, architectural, visual, and textual imagination of the city, and the creation of complex, temporary, soft, loose, and open-ended spaces via play, art, and civic actions. Our goal is to explore the multidimensional views of Seoul that are from above and below, inside out, monumental and mundane, singular and multiple, and local and global.","Oh,Se-Mi",ASIAN,378,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Course Objectives
The thematical objective of this course is to promote students’ dedication to cultural diversity in the contemporary context of globalization. History serves to keep records of past events, yet more crucially, to illuminate people’s thoughts and shape their behaviors. A necessary step of cultural diversity is to know, acknowledge, and appreciate people and things beyond the realm of our life and take them as a critical reflection of the self. In this course, students can expect to learn how communications and exchanges were established between China and the Middle East, as well as how they were influenced by various global or regional factors.","Li,Xiaoyue",ASIAN,397,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - China and the Middle East: Commodities, Ecology, Infrastructure",2,HU,Minicourse,"At least one course in Asian studies, especially on the topic addressed in the course.",This 2nd 7 week mini course will meet 3/8/21 - 4/21/21 with a drop/add deadline of 3/22/21.,May be elected three times for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.
Indian Religions and Western Thought,"This course examines the intellectual and cultural encounter between India and the West from the 1770s to the present day, a period that coincides with the entry of India into the historical experience of colonialism and modernity. It looks at how the discovery of knowledge about India affected debates in modern European philosophy and conversely examines the reception of European ideas in modern Indian thought. One of the outcomes of this encounter is that national culture in India and Europe developed in relation to a shared experience of colonialism in which notions of religion and secularity were crucial in evolving the idea of the nation in both regions. This course will examine how Western discourses of race, religion, secularity, gender, and spirituality were internalized by Indian elites and eventually deployed in the formation of socio-political and religious movements of reform and anti-colonial resistance. We shall look at how these reform movements shaped the nationalization of three distinct communities in colonial North India - Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh – and how encounters between these communities and the British helped to define some of the central problems of Indian democracy today.","Mandair,Arvind-Pal Singh",ASIAN,400,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,Junior and above.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Japan to 1700:  Origin Myth to Shogun Dynasty,"What lies behind the image of “Cool Japan,” represented by fuzzy robots, Super Mario, Toto toilets, and everything that is kawaii? The answer is Japan’s long, complex and intriguing past that stretches from the mythical age of gods and goddesses through our time. This course covers most of that history, from prehistory and the age of aristocrats to the rise of the samurai and their dominance both in total war and total peace (300BCE and 1700CE). We examine patterns of transformation along the twin axes of time and theme: ancient aristocrats’ political power and aesthetic authority; medieval militarism supported by land rights, urban economy, and sea power; and the early modern consolidation of the status order and overseas relations. Along the way, we visit issues of environment and disasters, blood and pollution, religious devotion and sexuality, Christianity and trade, family and gender, death and dying, and more. The course offers samples of translated primary sources, such as tales, chronicles, diaries, and documents, as well as scholarly essays, films, and video clips. They will expose students to the diversity of ideas and practices that emerged from the Japanese archipelago, different from our universalistic assumptions, often shaped by the knowledge of the West. These materials and our discussion should also lead students to question the notion of “the Japanese tradition,” much of which was constructed in modern times, and does a disservice to Japan’s premodern past through misrepresentation.","Tonomura,Hitomi",ASIAN,450,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Film Culture in Korea,"In 2019, Korean cinema celebrated the centennial anniversary of its birth. From the premier of Fight for Justice in 1919 to Parasite’s winning of Palme d’Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2019, Korean cinema has continuously developed and innovated itself, while inheriting and revising the legacies and traditions of the past eras. This course surveys the one-hundred-year history of Korean cinema with a strong emphasis on film aesthetics and styles. While the course will mostly follow the chronological order of films, its focus will be on textual and formal analysis of representative films of each period.","Kim,Ungsan",ASIAN,458,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Topics in Asian Studies,"The course focuses on one of the principal classics of ancient Chinese philosophy, the Zhuangzi (aka the Chuang-Tzu). Written in a humorous style, filled with fables, inside jokes, and metaphors, the work later came to be considered as one of the foundational texts of Daoism. Despite its jocular style of writing, the work touches on themes that are fundamental to the human condition, such as the distinction between “good” and “bad,” human and non-human, and life and death. As different characters grapple with these questions, they also simultaneously reflect on the most crucial question of all: how to live with joy in a world that is full of adversity. Although the focus of the course is the Zhuangzi itself, we will also contextualize the text within the broader classical Chinese philosophical tradition. Given that so much of what goes by the name ""classical Chinese philosophy"" is actively engaged in political discourse, this intertextual approach will also allow us to reflect on the extent to which many of the tales in the Zhuangzi could also be read as political satire.","Ozbey,Sonya",ASIAN,480,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Interpreting the Zhuangzi,3,,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

Introduction to Asian/Pacific American Studies,"“Asian American,” “Pacific Islander,” “APA,” “APIA,” even “APIDA”—these identifications encompass people whose heritage and ancestral homelands range from the Pacific Ocean across East and Southeast Asia to—and including—the Indian subcontinent. This course examines its diverse historical and contemporary experiences in the United States. 

By examining history, cultural productions,  and the political struggles of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, the course learning goals are as follows: 

Understand Asian migration to the U.S., to describe its past and present patterns, and to identify the legal, political, economic, social, and cultural circumstances that have shaped it.
 Understand the racial formation of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and to understand how these formations intersect with other racialized communities in the U.S.
Compare and contrast Asian/Pacific Islander American communities in the U.S. and to relate their past and present development in light of domestic and international conditions.
Analyze the diverse expressions of Asian/Pacific American identity as they intersect with other forms of identity, such as gender, class, sexuality, and religion.
Articulate informed positions on some of the mechanisms of exclusion and invisibility experienced by Asian and Pacific Islander American communities. 
Think and communicate analytically and compassionately about race and ethnicity in America. ","Desai,Manan R",ASIANPAM,214,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Asian/Pacific Islander American Studies and the Humanities,"Stories of undocumented immigrants are often couched in terms of silence and invisibility, using expressions like “living in the shadows” and “under the radar.” Many Immigrant rights activists, on the other hand, resist this silence and invisibility and see storytelling as a political act that makes the humanity of the undocumented impossible to ignore. This class is about the politics and literature of visibility in narratives that reveal undocumented lives, as well as the theory of literature as a tool for social justice. The texts we will study illuminate the people and circumstances behind undocumented immigration, the policies that make documentation precarious and out of reach, and the sweeping generalizations and dehumanization behind terms like “illegal alien.”","Anderson,Sigrid Michelle",ASIANPAM,311,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Literature of the Undocumented,3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

South Asian Diaspora in America,"In recent years, South Asian Americans have become an increasingly visible presence in American popular culture, as writers and characters on TV shows, stand-up comics, and most recently, the winners of Spelling Bees and Miss America Pageants. Such narratives have filled a convenient script for the “model minority” myth of the U.S., while troublingly glossing over reports that are far more dissonant with narratives of the American dream. Instances of racism and xenophobia against South Asian enclaves have occurred in the 1980s, while racial profiling and violence against South Asians, particularly Sikhs and Muslims, by state and non-state actors spiked after 9/11. But for more than a century, South Asians have played a key role in North American history, at the center of legal and historical cases that changed the parameters of race and citizenship in the U.S. and Canada. This course will explore this long history — from the earliest settlers who arrived in the late nineteenth century to the effects of the ""War on Terror.""

We will also consider how writers, filmmakers, and other artists have explored the experiences of diaspora and immigration, and the complex racial and gender politics of the U.S, through a series of guiding questions:

1.) What are the limits and possibilities of the category “South Asian American”?
2.) How have South Asians fit into and shaped the racial politics of the U.S.? And how do they overlap with the social categories of caste and religion?
3.) What kind of stereotypes have been constructed around South Asian people over the course of U.S. history? And how have South Asian Americans responded?
4.) How have South Asians organized communities in America? How have they been received by and how have they remade American society?","Desai,Manan R",ASIANPAM,359,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.

It looks at how the discovery of knowledge about India affected debates in modern European philosophy and conversely examines the reception of European ideas in modern Indian thought. One of the outcomes of this encounter is that national culture in India and Europe developed in relation to a shared experience of colonialism in which notions of religion and secularity were crucial in evolving the idea of the nation in both regions. This course will examine how Western discourses of race, religion, secularity, gender, and spirituality were internalized by Indian elites and eventually deployed in the formation of socio-political and religious movements of reform and anti-colonial resistance. We shall look at how these reform movements shaped the nationalization of three distinct communities in colonial North India - Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh – and how encounters between these communities and the British helped to define some of the central problems of Indian democracy today.","Mandair,Arvind-Pal Singh",ASIANPAM,405,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Indian Religions and Western Thought,3,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Capstone Seminar in Asian/Pacific Islander American Studies,"How have refugees experienced forced migration and resettlement in the United States, and what do their stories reveal about American life overall? Covering different historical periods and different refugee communities, this writing-intensive capstone seminar will address the history of the legal regulation of refugee migrations; the political debates surrounding refugees; the significance of religion, race, ethnicity, and national identity in refugee history; and the experiences of refugees in resettling and establishing a new life in a new society. We will take a transnational view of forced migration, with attention to the ways that war, empire, and foreign policy have shaped refugees’ lives. We will explore refugee experiences by reading recent historical literature and considering a rich array of the primary source material, including fiction, memoirs, government documents, oral history interviews, films, and maps. In particular, students will engage in the refugee oral histories collected through the Religion and Resettlement Project at Princeton University and produce writing that facilitates the public dissemination of that research.","Borja,Melissa M",ASIANPAM,498,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Refugees in America,4,ULWR,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Our “spacecraft” will be built from our imagination, but its destinations will reflect what astronomy and physics have revealed about the nature of our Universe. We will see the Solar System from different planets, look back at the Sun from neighboring stars, and travel throughout our home Galaxy even as we prepare to embark to distant galaxies and beyond. As we travel extremely far from home, we will find that we also have to move back in time to see how the galaxies, stars, the Sun, and the Earth came about in the first place. The physical concepts that we require to understand what we see will be introduced as we go along, and some of these will be used many times during the course.

 In this course, we will discuss the on-going search for extra-terrestrial life. We will place a strong focus on the scientific hurdles that lie in our understanding the development of life and for its potential evolution towards interstellar travel and communication. The framework of the course will be based upon the Drake Equation, first posed to estimate the total number of intelligent civilizations that might exist in the Galaxy at a given time. Thus we will take a census of the potential for life beyond Earth through an exploration of our own solar system. We will then survey beyond our own star system to the exciting search for “extra-solar” planets and their biological potential. We will end with a group activity where students and professors will try to estimate how many ET civilizations might exist and then move on to discuss our future potential to travel to the stars.

Black Holes: The Triumph of Gravity,"Black holes are among the most fascinating concepts in Astronomy. A natural prediction of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, they can be described as a gravitational singularity inducing infinite curvature into the fabric of space-time. Thus, the relation between time and space gets warped near these objects, generating some of the strangest phenomena in the universe. Although black holes do not emit light directly, their presence can be inferred via extreme effects on their environment. Paradoxically, black holes turn out to be the brightest sources of radiation across the entire universe. Even more surprisingly, black holes can convert infalling matter into bipolar jets that accelerate up to a substantial fraction of the speed of light. In turn, these jets can profoundly alter the properties of the black hole environment on large scales. Supermassive black holes are thought to play a crucial role in regulating the evolution and overall properties of their host galaxies – akin to an object the size of a coin dictating the growth of a city the size of Detroit. This class addresses the most basic questions about the nature of black holes, their formation, observational appearance, and ultimate fate.","Ruszkowski,Mateusz",ASTRO,206,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"BS, NS, QR/1",,"3 credits of any Astronomy course, with the exception of ASTRO 183 and ASTRO 261.",,May not be repeated for credit.,

Legacy of the Holocaust in Yugoslav Culture: How and Why We Need to Narrate the Holocaust,"

The course’s primary focus is raising awareness about the historical and global persistence of racism and politics of intolerance that informs the daily lives of citizens. The reading list consists of new writings on the Holocaust created in response to the contemporary recurrence of various forms of racism, anti-Semitism, and right-wing politics in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Students will be encouraged to think about the resurrection of racist rhetoric manifested in ethnic particularism, strong anti-Semitic sentiments, and not infrequently, official anti-Roma politics. The course also makes a necessary link with racism underlying economic or even security arguments (be it the Arizona anti-immigrant law, the dislocation of the Roma by the Serbian or British governments for reasons of urban development, the abandonment of the boat with African immigrants by the Italian Navy, or the anti-Roma laws in Slovakia quoting crime prevention).
Since the rise in racism in Europe is linked to the fall of Communism, the enlargement of the EU, global migrations, as well as a long economic crisis, students will be invited to make connections between these social processes capable of producing seismic shifts and creating the fertile soil for the dissemination of racist ideas. Students will be encouraged to explore the link between the past and present, rather than read the primary texts as monuments to the past, the past that mankind keeps vowing will never repeat. Students will be invited to think why texts about the Holocaust can be particularly instructive about the reemergence of racist ideologies that are resurrected at times of social crisis.

Finally, to answer the question of “how” we write about the Holocaust, the reading list contains very diverse narrative techniques that in strange and painful ways immerse the reader in the position of the victim. The reading list consists of primary texts about the Holocaust in Eastern Europe and the Balkans that frequently treat the subject in novel and unexpected ways. The secondary literature is composed of essays, excerpts, filmic and documentary material intended to foster discussion about racism and anti-Semitism not merely as the event of the past and firmly connected to the period of the Nazi occupation of Europe, but as a global occurrence that may and does affect our lives at present.Course Requirements:Evaluation: based on class participation, midterm presentation, final project (if paper, 10-12 pp, otherwise run your project idea with instructor prior to starting it), and the oral presentation of the project-paper, bi-weekly quizzes and weekly discussion questions.","Aleksic,Tatjana",BCS,350,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Mathematical Modeling in Biology,"The complexities of the biological sciences make interdisciplinary involvement essential and the increasing use of mathematics in biology is inevitable as biology becomes more quantitative. Mathematical biology is a fast-growing and exciting modern application of mathematics that has gained worldwide recognition. In this course, mathematical models that suggest possible mechanisms that may underlie specific biological processes are developed and analyzed. Another major emphasis of the course is illustrating how these models can be used to predict what may follow under currently untested conditions. The course moves from classical to contemporary models at the population, organ, cellular, and molecular levels. The goals of this course are: (i) Critical understanding of the use of differential equation methods in mathematical biology and (ii) Exposure to specialized mathematical and computational techniques which are required to study ordinary differential equations that arise in mathematical biology.

Introduction to Global Change:  The Science Behind Sustainability," Everyday, human and natural activities are altering the planet on which we live. Through our increasing resource consumption, population growth, disturbance of natural systems, and technological advancement, we are changing the global climate and environment in a manner that is unique over Earth’s history. Many of these changes are degrading the physical and biological processes that underpin Earth’s life-support systems, which poses a great challenge for society in this century.
 This course, Global Change — the Science of Sustainability, investigates the causes and impacts of these changes using a combination of traditional lecture-based and modern digital teaching methodologies. The course surveys the evolution and interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes on Earth; how past changes on Earth help us predict the future, especially with respect to climate change; and how fundamental principles of science establish the sustainability of human activities on Earth. Students apply learned knowledge by using ‘systems modeling’ and spreadsheet software to investigate the dynamics of natural systems and examine case studies of relevant environmental problems.
  The course curriculum provides excellent opportunities to conduct research on topics of interest to the students, culminating in a course project presented at the end of the academic term. The interactive laboratory exercises provide students the opportunity to use software tools to examine how natural systems function as well as develop projections of the future consequences of changes in the environment. And, perhaps most important of all, students will have ample time for discussion of critical issues in natural resources and sustainability, and the role of environmental science in policy and society as a whole. All topics are developed in a manner that students will find both accessible and interesting. After the course, students should be able to discern sound science from biased claims and will have a foundation for making informed decisions about sustainable practices in their own lives.

Fundamental Physics for the Life Sciences II,"Have you ever wondered how physics is important and useful in the fields of biology chemistry, and medicine? BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 250 is a new introductory physics course that will reveal the synergy between these fields and explore fundamental physics principles that are ubiquitous in the life sciences. Biology, chemistry, and medicine will provide our guiding motivation and context for exploring first-semester physics topics including energy, mechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics. These topics will be covered in the depth and manner in which they appear on the MCAT and in life science courses. In line with this, students will also learn to use quantitative reasoning, develop mathematical models, and engage in scientific dialogue with a diverse group of future scientists and healthcare professionals. This course examines physical concepts through biological examples and consists of both interactive lectures and studio meetings to facilitate student learning and enhance student performance. Lectures will encourage student participation through a variety of in-class activities in which students work directly with, discuss, and respond to lecture material and demonstrations. During studio meetings, students will gain hands-on experience solving physics problems in small groups, facilitated by an instructor and peer learning assistants.","Chaney,Andrea",BIOPHYS,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS, QR/1",,"PHYSICS 135 or BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 150.

The course will introduce to the students most commonly used biophysical methods for
studying the molecular mechanism of complex diseases and therapy development. The emphasis will
be on protein misfolding diseases (Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and prion), but diseases like cancer, viral
(HIV) and bacterial infections will be also discussed. Classical biophysical methods like x-ray
crystallography, NMR and cryoEM will be discussed, as well as, the most recent developments of the
cutting-edge methods. Some lectures will be presented by invited speakers who will talk about their
disease studies for which they apply a combination of biophysical, biochemical and molecular
techniques.Course Requirements:For Fall 2020: testing for the course will be synchronous and will consist of multiple choice, short answer, and assay questions that will be submitted via Canvas.

Biweekly problem-solving homework assignments, assigned readings, weekly quizzes, two exams (20 pts each), one final paper (5-7 pages)that critically explores the biophysical basis for a student-chosen human disease and discusses how an in-depth biophysical understanding of the disease process can help in the rational design of therapeutics.

Mathematical Modeling in Biology,"The complexities of the biological sciences make interdisciplinary involvement essential and the increasing use of mathematics in biology is inevitable as biology becomes more quantitative. Mathematical biology is a fast-growing and exciting modern application of mathematics that has gained worldwide recognition. In this course, mathematical models that suggest possible mechanisms that may underlie specific biological processes are developed and analyzed. Another major emphasis of the course is illustrating how these models can be used to predict what may follow under currently untested conditions. The course moves from classical to contemporary models at the population, organ, cellular, and molecular levels. The goals of this course are: (i) Critical understanding of the use of differential equation methods in mathematical biology and (ii) Exposure to specialized mathematical and computational techniques which are required to study ordinary differential equations that arise in mathematical biology. By the end of this course, students will be able to derive, interpret, solve, understand, discuss, and critique discrete and differential equation models of biological systems.

In addition to bathing, the bathhouse embodied many cultural facets of the Roman realm and ultimately became a vital entity that encapsulated romanitas, the Roman experience of life. We will utilize a large plethora of sources — archaeological remains of architecture and sculpture, inscriptions, Greek and Latin literary sources as well as numerous Jewish sources in Hebrew and Aramaic, in order to trace the cultural dynamics in the bathhouse.

In addition to studying the plays as great theater in their own right, we will consider them both with and against Shakespeare’s ancient Greek and Roman sources in Plautus, Vergil, Ovid, Seneca, Plutarch, and others (all studied in translation), so as to grasp how Shakespeare staged, transformed, and adapted the ancient world for audiences of his day.","Dufallo,Basil J",CLCIV,120,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Shakespeare's Classics,3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,
First-year Seminar in Classical Civilization (Humanities),"Have you ever wondered why some places are the focus of long-lived settlements? And what does make a settlement into a city? The monumentality of its buildings? The range of its infrastructures? Or, merely, the size and density of its population? In this seminar, we investigate the rise of urbanism in the Old World from a comparative perspective. We explore the nature of the earliest known villages in the Near East and of the first cities in Mesopotamia, India, China, and the ancient Mediterranean. Through the archaeological evidence, we look at how these urban centers were planned, built, and lived. Rome is our special case study: we will analyze and discuss the preliminary results of an ongoing UofM research project in the “eternal city”.","Motta,Laura",CLCIV,120,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Building Blocks of Urban Life: Old World Early Cities,3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,
Mini Course in Classical Civilization,"In this class we will time-travel to Rome to witness the political tumult and machinations that led to the exile of Cicero, the assassination of Julius Caesar, civil war, and, ultimately to the collapse of the Republic. Against material remains and literary evidence from, Caesar, Cicero, and Plutarch, we will explore the decisions, challenges, and opportunities presented to the creators of historical fiction –– both literary and filmic (Harris’ Dictator, Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, HBO’s Rome). As a final project, students will try their own hand at synthesizing into a ""fictional"" scene raw materials of historical record based on their own choosing.","Soter,Gina Marie",CLCIV,125,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Art of Historical Fiction,1,HU,Minicourse,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 3 credit(s).

Topics in the Ancient World,"In this course, students will be introduced to Ancient Greek Tragedy and Comedy, performance genres full of elements both strikingly alien and familiar to us. As we read through some of the most complex and strange examples of these genres, we will simultaneously grapple with topics such as the cultural and political contexts of artistic performance in ancient Athens, how the Greeks both absorbed and rejected aspects of neighboring cultures (especially Persia), tragedy's and comedy's relationship with the invention of democracy, and Greek conceptions of gender and sexuality. Major works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes will be read in English translation.","Foster,Margaret C",CLCIV,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Greek Drama,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Women in the Ancient Mediterranean,"


Women make up half the population, and yet we have little evidence of their experiences in their own words for most of human history. This course engages creatively and deeply with the limits of historical knowledge by exploring the lives of women in antiquity. Focusing on the multicultural world of the Roman empire, we will examine the roles of women in the political, domestic, and religious spheres, as well as how women were implicated in major cultural transformations, such as the rise of Christianity. Through sources that include literary texts, medical treatises, material culture, and works of art, students will learn to read against the grain in order to explore the opportunities and obstacles that women faced long ago – and, in certain ways, still, face today.","Freidin,Anna Bonnell",CLCIV,303,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Topics in Classical Civilization,"In this course, we’ll read portions of five Greek and Roman epic poems: Homer’s Odyssey, Apollonius’ Argonautica, Virgil’s Aeneid, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and Statius Thebaid. Our focus will be on the role of love and desire in works that center on war, adventure, and national identity, as well as on techniques of story-telling and narrative.","Caston,Ruth Rothaus",CLCIV,350,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Love and War in Ancient Epic,3,HU,,CLCIV 101 and 102.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,
Topics in Classical Civilization,"This is a course about memory studies using the case study of modern Germany and its relation to the Roman past. We will explore how German philosophers, literary authors, and painters thought about their present through the lens of the Roman past. The issues that this involves are the construction of national/imperial identity; but also, more specifically, the re-appropriation of the opposition of Roman conqueror versus “barbarian”; and the inter-textual and inter-visual presence of ancient texts, works of art, and architecture. We will read essays by Karl Marx, Ernest Renan, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and other authors in order to create our intellectual framework for memory studies.

Ancient Medicine in Greece & Rome,"Why did ancient patients seek medical care from exorcists? Why did Hippocrates believe that a woman's uterus could move around her body? Why did ancient kings allow doctors to dissect the bodies of living criminals? These are some of the questions that this course will answer while covering more than two thousand years of medical history. In learning how to analyze works by Hippocrates and other medical writers from Greece, Rome, and the Middle East, students will discover that modern debates about bio-ethics, mental illness, gender and racial biases in healthcare, and the role of 'alternative' therapies have their roots in antiquity.","Schironi,Francesca",CLCIV,392,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Studying Antiquity,"Vergil’s Aeneid is many things: a complex epic that engages the Greco-Roman literary tradition in novel and nuanced ways; a treasure house of mythological story-telling and historical reference that exploits the interplay of fact and fiction; a trenchant reflection of (and on) the historical, social, cultural, and monumental moment in which it was written; and an enduring and exceptionally rich text for interpretation, translation, and re-imagining in both creative and scholarly contexts from antiquity to the modern era. As such, the poem offers something of interest for every student of Classical Studies. The first half of this course will center on close reading and discussion of the Aeneid and the array of interpretive issues that it has prompted since it entered the public sphere upon its author’s death. Out of this collective work, each student will develop a research question from a topic of their choosing and write a paper that engages not only the epic but also the ideas of other scholars on the same topic and question. The research process will be completed in stages over the second half of the term, accompanied by opportunities to revisit issues raised in the first half of the course and supported by peer review in Section 002 of the course.","Berlin,Netta",CLCIV,480,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Vergil's Aeneid,2,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Introduction to Global Change:  The Science Behind Sustainability," Everyday, human and natural activities are altering the planet on which we live. Through our increasing resource consumption, population growth, disturbance of natural systems, and technological advancement, we are changing the global climate and environment in a manner that is unique over Earth’s history. Many of these changes are degrading the physical and biological processes that underpin Earth’s life-support systems, which poses a great challenge for society in this century.
 This course, Global Change — the Science of Sustainability, investigates the causes and impacts of these changes using a combination of traditional lecture-based and modern digital teaching methodologies. The course surveys the evolution and interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes on Earth; how past changes on Earth help us predict the future, especially with respect to climate change; and how fundamental principles of science establish the sustainability of human activities on Earth. Students apply learned knowledge by using ‘systems modeling’ and spreadsheet software to investigate the dynamics of natural systems and examine case studies of relevant environmental problems.
  The course curriculum provides excellent opportunities to conduct research on topics of interest to the students, culminating in a course project presented at the end of the academic term. The interactive laboratory exercises provide students the opportunity to use software tools to examine how natural systems function as well as develop projections of the future consequences of changes in the environment. And, perhaps most important of all, students will have ample time for discussion of critical issues in natural resources and sustainability, and the role of environmental science in policy and society as a whole. All topics are developed in a manner that students will find both accessible and interesting. After the course, students should be able to discern sound science from biased claims and will have a foundation for making informed decisions about sustainable practices in their own lives.

Mathematical Ecology,"

The study of ecology is the study of complex systems that are intrinsically dynamic and quantitative. Ecologists formulate mathematical models to describe this complexity; the equations that result are interesting both for their biological predictions and their mathematical form. Full analytical solution of model equations is typically impossible, yet to the mathematically prepared mind, they can yield up their secrets.

This course is intended to provide students with the tools needed to formulate and analyze ecological models. It is an overview of the major categories of models and the mathematical techniques available for their analysis.  Although the focus is on ecological dynamics, students in other disciplines will find the methods readily applicable to their own fields.Course Requirements:The course presumes mathematical maturity at the level of advanced calculus with prior exposure to ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and probability.","King, Aaron A",CMPLXSYS,466,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"MATH 217, 417, or 419; MATH 256, 286, or 316; and MATH 450 or 451.",,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Language and Human Mind,"This course introduces students to the “cognitive revolution” and its impact on the contemporary study of language. We review the shift away from seeing speech behavior or “languages” as the object of inquiry to the experimental and theoretical study of the cognitive mechanisms underlying our unique human capacity for language, the exercise of which permeates virtually every aspect of human life, including what you are now doing! In every household, all of the children, barring pathology - but none of the dogs, cats or other organisms (nor the inanimate objects!) - acquire the language spoken (or signed) by the adults. There is some biological property of humans that makes this feat possible. What do we know when we know a language, and what does it mean to say that humans have an innate capacity for language?","Brennan,Jonathan R",COGSCI,209,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Special Topics for Cognitive Science,"It’s a common bit of folk wisdom that you ought to ‘trust your gut.’ If a particular course of action intuitively seems right or if an answer on an exam ‘feels’ correct, you ought to go with your instinct (or so the adage suggests). Beyond mere folk wisdom, intuition has figured centrally in discussions of philosophical methodology. Many theorists claim that intuitions are a crucial and foundational source of evidence for inquiry into the nature of free will, knowledge, morality, and other philosophically foundational notions. But what exactly are intuitions and what implications might a scientifically developed theory of intuition have for folk wisdom and philosophical methodology alike? In this course, we engage with research in cognitive psychology, social psychology, and neuroscience to examine the nature of intuitions and how they are realized in the mind/brain. In addition, we read work on intuition and philosophical methodology to examine what role intuitions have (or ought to have) for an investigation into some of our most fundamental and philosophically important concepts.","Munroe,Wade",COGSCI,301,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Intuition and Inquiry,3,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,
Topics in Moral Psychology,"Moral psychology is an interdisciplinary area of study drawing from both philosophy and empirical cognitive science. Topics in moral psychology are both psychological and ethical in nature, such as moral judgment, moral motivation, moral agency and responsibility, and moral emotions. In this course, we'll examine these phenomena, with a particular focus on moral cognition. Some of the questions we'll explore include the following: Is moral cognition driven primarily by emotion or reasoning? Which areas of the brain are involved in moral judgment? Is moral judgment analogous to language? Are moral judgments necessarily motivating? Are any emotions distinctively moral in nature? Can psychopaths tell us anything interesting about the nature of moral judgment or which capacities – affective, cognitive, or both? – are necessary for moral agency? More generally, we will consider what empirical findings from the cognitive sciences can (and can't) tell us about morality and human moral thought and behavior. Course readings will reflect the interdisciplinary nature of moral psychology as a field of inquiry, and will include a mix of philosophical readings and contemporary empirical work in cognitive science.

"The Media, Past and Present","This class provides an introduction to the evolution and impact of the mass media and digital media on American culture.  Because the media have been, since the late 19th century, the major storytellers of our time, we will focus on the stories they have told us over the years, and provide you with important stories about the media, past, and present. We will review the ideological, technological, industrial, and regulatory developments that have produced our existing media ecosystem, and consider how media content has, over the years, inspired considerable controversy over who should get to tell stories through the media and should not. Our goal is to provide you with a sense of the strong connections between the history of the mass media and their present-day formations and uses in the United States and to provide you with the critical tools and language to deconstruct their storytelling assumptions and techniques.","Douglas,Susan J",COMM,101,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Media Processes and Effects,"Despite dramatic changes in the media landscape, we still take the media for granted. Having access to information, communication, and content through media is an increasingly important part of the social landscape. Starting with its historical roots, this class traces the uses and consequences of mediated messages and communication technology. The class emphasizes research that has developed within the social science tradition. In that sense, it complements COMM101, which emphasizes developments from critical and cultural studies. Throughout the term, students will have opportunities to both learn and directly experience social science research on the uses and consequences of today’s and yesterday’s media.

First-year Seminar in Media Issues,"This first-year seminar is about the history and politics of journalism in Africa. Print technology arrived in Africa in the mid-19th century as part of the apparatus of colonial rule. African intellectuals quickly recognized print technology as a useful means of addressing new audiences. In the 1930s and 40s, African nationalists used newspapers to define and defend the cultural norms that drew them together as a people. In the 1950s urban populists found in newspapers a vehicle by which to mobilize campaigns. In the 1960s and 70s, after independence, African governments sought to close down avenues of free speech. But newspapermen kept publishing, and in the 1990s newspapers were the forums where a new generation of democratic politics could be conceived. Each week we will focus on a different newspaper. We'll discuss the newspaper that Mahatma Gandhi published in South Africa during the 1920s. We'll talk about the 'Voice of Uganda', which was an instrument for Idi Amin's dictatorship. We’ll study the politics of Drum, a news magazine that made African cities look posh, modern, and romantic. Nowhere was the ‘news’ simply available, ready to be reported. African editors made choices about what was newsworthy, and by their news-making work, they encouraged their readers to see themselves as sharers of particular experiences. Our interest here is in how newsmen used to print to create news, address the public, organize people, and open up paths of political action.

Survey of Media Topics,"In this course, you learn how to think and write about reality television like a media scholar. Few elements of media culture are as loved or as hated as much as reality programs. Rather than debate whether or not reality television is “good” or “bad” for us, you learn the more rigorous approaches that researchers take when they examine and write about reality television. Specifically, this course provides you with opportunities to practice researching and writing about how reality programs construct social norms, especially how they suggest to viewers that there are proper and improper lifestyles. Through screenings, discussions, readings, and writing assignments, you engage with others’ ideas in order to perform analyses of your own. To do that, you conduct what media scholars call “close readings,” or meticulous analyses in which you identify and then articulate how the stories told in episodes of reality television programs reveal information about the world around us. Far more than “trash,” reality television shines a light on the contemporary U.S., suggesting a great deal about who we are as a people and what drives us as a culture.","Griffin, Hollis  ",COMM,305,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Reality TV,3,,,COMM 101 and COMM 102 strongly recommended.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Survey of Media Topics in the Humanities,"Judaism--as religion, race, ethnicity, and culture--is a fascinating area of study for communication scholars. Jewish Americans have long experienced many forms of in-betweenness (insider/outsider, ""model minority""/marginalized, White/racialized ""Other,"" etc.). In this course, students will gain first-hand knowledge of how American Jewish identity is conceived and represented, ranging from stand-up comedy to films about the Holocaust, from documentaries about Jewish tattooing to ethnographies about kosher butchers in small-town Iowa, and from Jewish hip hop artists to vampires. Students will come away with a better knowledge of what it means to ""be"" Jewish in the US and how that is represented, and how understanding Jewish identity lends to better understanding other identity issues.","Moshin,Jamie Eric",COMM,306,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Representing American Jewishness,4,"RE, HU",,"COMM 101, a previous humanities course, or sophomore standing.",,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Survey of Media Topics in the Humanities,"Media determine our situation. This course explores their history. How have technologies such as photography, film, radio, and the computer altered the human senses, our relationship to space and time, to each other, to institutions and governments? In what ways do new technologies shape the questions we ask about the natural world and the answers we give? How have critical approaches for thinking about media evolved over the past two hundred years, and what contributions have German-speaking thinkers in particular made to media theory? Drawing on a wide range of materials including scholarly articles, primary documents, photographs, films, literary texts, and audio recordings, we will work to develop a critical vocabulary and historical framework for analyzing the varied and widely distributed effects of technological change on both patterns of thought and physical reality, the imagination and the body, social relations, and their material networks and infrastructures. Topics include the so-called ‘reading revolution’ in late eighteenth-century Europe, print culture and the Enlightenment, human mediumship, spiritualism, and the occult, technology, and science, sound recording and the voice, radio and the Third Reich, cyborgs, and the ‘post-human,’ automation and surveillance, democracy and digital activism.","Whitney,Tyler",COMM,306,"Fall 2021, ",Section 005, - Media Matter,3,HU,,"COMM 101, a previous humanities course, or sophomore standing.",,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Survey of Media Topics in the Humanities,"Media saturate our lives from waking up to a cellphone alarm to having lunch with a favorite television show to after-dinner dishwashing accompanied by Spotify. Within this abundance, what qualities draw our eyes and attention to particular content? From the emotional excess of The Real Housewives to instant replays during live sports, from the epic worlds of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to the musical ‘spectaculars’ of the 1950s (and today), this class will explore how media present, produce, and play with spectacle. We will consider questions such as: What is the difference between making a spectacle and making a spectacle of oneself? Are spectacles mere distractions from a commodified, mundane world? Can a spectacle unite an audience (and a society) in celebration, shock, or grief?


This class will engage with a range of historical and contemporary media content and will provide an overview of different approaches and methods in media studies. We will explore historic, cultural, and economic frameworks for understanding what a spectacle is. We will pay close attention to the relationship between spectacle and the sensorium: what we see, hear, taste, smell, and touch. Then we will narrow our focus to case studies in different categories of spectacle including aesthetic, technological, emotional, catastrophic, political, embodied, and the non-spectacular, the banal. If spectacles are everywhere, how do we identify the truly spectacular?","Saidel, Emily  ",COMM,306,"Fall 2021, ",Section 006, - Spectacle in the Media,4,HU,,"COMM 101, a previous humanities course, or sophomore standing.",,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Songs are obviously a powerful mode of communication, and many musicians have had an outsize influence outside of the sphere of music in a strict sense: but what does this mean for everyone else, and how does the form of “song” relate to our day-to-day experience?

In other words, while some things are lost when a text is fragmented, fragmentation also enables us to consider a text from new and exciting perspectives.

Writing World Literatures,"We tend to associate some books with theory, tight analysis, logical proof, sound argument while other books with stories, gripping drama, believable (though not necessarily true) historical accounts. In this course, we’ll look at these two different kinds of narratives from a comparative perspective, explore how their features might operate successfully in the same text, and think about the challenges of integrating personal stories within impersonal narratives like a research paper. We will read writers that have used storytelling to create arguments in ways that the personal and the academic interact harmoniously, producing interesting and meaningful narratives. You will learn to recognize some of the generic features of personal and impersonal essays and fuse them in your texts while creating valuable works that have a lasting impact on your audience. We will examine strategies to re-create your life experiences while developing a sound and logical argument. Some of the topics covered in this course are creating intriguing plots, unforgettable characters, and dramatic dialogues. At the same time, we will read, summarize, analyze, and synthesize articles to generate and support your own essays. At the end of the course, you will be able to understand how personal stories compare to other writing forms, approach different writing genres critically, and integrate devices from many sources and genres in your essays. A significant amount of class time will be devoted to workshopping your texts, to discussions, and to reading authors known for integrating scholarly and personal narratives in their works.","Parra Garcia,Ivan",COMPLIT,122,"Fall 2021, ",Section 007, - The Art of Storytelling in Academic Narratives,4,FYWR,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Writing World Literatures,"What are some terms that come up in your mind when you hear the term “World Literature”? Does it include traveling texts, translations, give and take, and a transposition of the local and the exotic? Does World Literature start at a particular historical moment, and what were the ways in which brought different locations and times together in its fold? This course looks at the ways in which World Literature is framed and produced historically and in geographical terms. often associated with a moment in history where texts from several locations across the globe began colliding with each other, beyond national and linguistic literary traditions. At the same time, however, the origins of World Literature are tied up in the dubious histories of Orientalism and the dispersal of texts across the globe via colonialism. How does one sort out these messy histories, if at all? Additionally, this ‘moment’ also serves as an organizing time- one which bind all corners of the world together. Can one think of interactions between texts, authors, readers, and translators beyond one singular modern moment that world literature crafts, and through inhabiting multiple, colliding worlds? The course readings will take us from the so-called Progressive Writers of Hindi and Urdu, to the New Poetry of Iran, and the literary Renaissance of Arabic- all willingly or unwillingly responding to this shared global ‘moment’, to think about how various participants with varying stakes, interact with one another within this space of global intimacy and dynamically think about what constitutes “good” writing. What then constitutes “good” writing and reading within a global scale? The readings in the course will then also think about how literature is a way of training both readers and writers in accordance with the idea of ‘taste’, and how this might reflect on our moment, and our practices as writers and readers of literature.

First-Year Literary Seminar,The climate apocalypse is no longer the stuff of science fiction. How do contemporary literature and cinema represent the end of the world when the world is ending now?

Literature Across Borders,"This course takes a transnational perspective towards the subject of “Home” and its cultural construction among immigrants, refugees, and displaced people: what does it mean to “be home” or displaced, how is it privileged and imagined, and how is it contested. Exploring a wide range of multiple media--literary texts, films, popular music, and art—the class will closely articulate the aesthetic, linguistic, and thematic conceptions of home—its borders, bodies, interior, doors, and bridges—that have generated historical claims, political identity, utopian contours, and conceptions of insiders and foreigner, and the corollary social understanding of human rights. Special attention will be paid to the constitutive role of literature—oral, textual, or visual—within different narratives.","Tsoffar,Ruth",COMPLIT,240,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - HOME, Homeland and Homelessness",3,HU,,,This course may be counted toward the International Studies subplan in Comparative Culture and Identity.

Global Humanities,"""We hear the term “trauma” invoked in the context of worldwide natural disasters, humanitarian catastrophes, and political violence. We may have even heard it used in the ongoing discussions provoked by #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo -- movements which suggest that “trauma” stems not just from an event, but can also be embedded in structures and experiences.","Randall, Renee Ragin",COMPLIT,300,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Global Narratives of Trauma,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

We will focus less on the athletic feats themselves than on their intricate connection to the city with regard to race, city planning, the rise of the unions, the car industry, politics, social unrest, the city’s triumphs, and defeats. Sports are a mirror of American society; sites of intense conflict, they also have a unique ability to bring together those who have nothing in common. At the end of the semester, you will have gained a deeper understanding of that most American of cities that lies less than an hour away from Ann Arbor; you will also have learned to think about sports as a richly nuanced cultural practice that is inextricably connected to our lives, whether we are fans or not.","Weineck,Silke-Maria",COMPLIT,300,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Detroit: Sports and the City of Champions,1,HU,Minicourse,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Translating World Literatures,"Translation, derived etymologically from the Latin transferre, means to “bear across” and has historically been used to describe the movement of both ideas over linguistic terrains and human bodies (and body parts) over physical terrains. But in a world beset by mass migrations and forced displacements across politically fraught borders, what precisely are the roles, ethics, and aims of translation today? How can translation facilitate and empower voices and stories of migration without co-opting them? How to protect and honor the labor of translators without reproducing the structures of individualized authorship that have traditionally excluded and/or marginalized them?","Stroebel, Will  ",COMPLIT,322,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Translation and Migration,3,"ULWR, HU",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

We will examine fiction in its historical contexts from the mid-nineteenth century through the early twentieth century to explore how Japanese writers and intellectuals engaged with the changing world of the last century and a half. Themes will include: modernism and modernity, nostalgia and homesickness, empire and its aftermath, and the cultures of globalization.

Literature and the Body,"What does it mean to love? As both a literary genre and a system of emotion, romance has played a crucial role in answering this question across the Middle East, from the novels of late antiquity (Greek and Latin) to medieval Islamic and Christian tales of love (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, French, and Georgian), including the great books of Layli & Majnun, the 1001 Nights, and the Haft Paykar. This class offers an introduction to the romantic tradition through a close reading of some of its prominent examples, with an eye for how they construct and subvert their own ideology: even as they vaunt chastity and fidelity, normative gender roles, and licit sex (typically heterosexual marriage) as ideal virtues, they simultaneously interrogate those ideals with numerous cases of betrayal, murder, castration, gender-bending, and illicit sex (incest, adultery). The role of women in society, and their agency in shaping their stories and destinies, lies at the center of this negotiation and will be a constant focal point for us throughout the course. Although we will connect these texts with modern examples, the bulk of our readings are drawn from the pre-modern period, which will afford us a better understanding of where romantic love comes from, and a diachronic view into points of difference and similarity with its modern incarnations. In this seminar class, students will develop a framework for critically unpacking contemporary notions of love, allowing them to reconsider how such seemingly universal experiences can be conditioned by society and culture, yet also to recognize the drives, emotions, and obsessions that we may know from our personal lives in people who lived and loved centuries ago and continents away.
For each session, active participation in class discussion, with students taking turns in leadership roles, will be expected. One blog post of about 500 words will be assigned every week, and every 2--3 weeks, a written assignment of 1250-1500 words will be due. A short reflection paper will be turned in at the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to develop your skills in critical reading, writing, thinking, and analysis.","Cross,Cameron",COMPLIT,374,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Sin, Sex, and Desire: Romance in the Middle East",3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,
Literature and Ideas,"The course will explore the simultaneous elaboration of the concept of race, and of European racism, with that of human rights, proposed as equal and universal to all. This evident tension, if not contradiction between Europe that elaborates concepts of human rights, and the Europe that brings into being the most egregious concepts of race, happens thanks to colonialism and Europe's commitment to empire, and also the history of European nationalism. And so, the course will begin historically, with that.","Herwitz,Daniel Alan",COMPLIT,376,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Humanitarianism and Morals,4,"RE, HU",,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

"The Art of Dance: An Introduction to American and European Dance History, Aesthetics, and Criticism","Did you know that Louis XIV was one of the greatest dancers of his time and that he used to dance to promote his political power? Did you know that George Balanchine’s ballet Agon was his way of championing civil rights in the year of Little Rock by creating one of his most powerful and intimate couple dances for a black man and a white woman? Did you know that Shakespeare and his company performed complex social dances to entertain their audiences at the finish of a play? Did you know that Michael Jackson did not invent the moonwalk? And that Beyoncé’s empowering of women through dance, has roots in the dance of the early twentieth century? 
Dance is one of our most significant art forms with a long and rich history, yet it has been neglected by historians in the academy until relatively recently. This course, open to all, is an introduction to the history of theatrical dance and its place in culture in Europe and America. What is dance’s role in our society and how does it reflect the values of the time in which it was produced? What has been the role of the dancer and choreographer at various times throughout history? What did their audiences expect? How can we recognize and analyze different styles of dance? This course surveys theatrical dance from the Renaissance through the twenty-first century including ballet, modern and post-modern dance, African American jazz forms, and dance in the movies.  No previous experience or knowledge of dance or dance history is necessary – only an interest in the subject. Open to all students (LSA and otherwise).

Dance Women/Dancing Queer,"Integration was central to both the theories and practices of mid-twentieth-century American race relations. This course brings together content and methods from dance studies and performance studies to consider responses to integration, from landmark civil rights legal decisions to social and art movements that questioned mainstream understandings of integrations' potential denial of racial difference. The course will be anchored in key examples drawn from American dance from 1930-1970, but will also include the study of complementary performances in theatre and musical theatre. The course will develop students' performance analysis skills through close readings of choreographic works, plays, and librettos, as well as introducing students to performance studies' approaches appropriate for considering embodied forms of public engagement, including civil rights protests and political speeches, as performance. Interweaving dance and performance studies in a final writing project will provide undergraduate students with a dance-specific paper appropriate for application to graduate programs in dance studies and performance studies. The class will also provide historical and theoretical concepts students can deploy in their work as artists and as critically-engaged audience members.

How have critical approaches for thinking about media evolved over the past two hundred years, and what contributions have German-speaking thinkers in particular made to media theory? Drawing on a wide range of materials including scholarly articles, primary documents, photographs, films, literary texts, and audio recordings, we will work to develop a critical vocabulary and historical framework for analyzing the varied and widely distributed effects of technological change on both patterns of thought and physical reality, the imagination and the body, social relations, and their material networks and infrastructures. Topics include the so-called ‘reading revolution’ in late eighteenth-century Europe, print culture and the Enlightenment, human mediumship, spiritualism, and the occult, technology, and science, sound recording and the voice, radio and the Third Reich, cyborgs, and the ‘post-human,’ automation and surveillance, democracy and digital activism.","Whitney,Tyler",DIGITAL,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Digital Media Studies,"This class will examine both representations of identity and the lived experiences of users online. During the early history of the Internet, gender play and experimentation were practiced in many ways, from games to seemingly non-fictional self-representations. Despite this sense of free play, representations of online gender often became stereotypical, shoring up categories like ""geek"" and ""cute"" in, particularly technological contexts. While we no longer live in an era when the Internet is an anonymous place, online cultures still celebrate identity and representation. This course takes a media studies approach that is informed by cultural studies, material history, and cultural ethnography.


Along the way, we’ll study selfies, profiles, social media platforms, online socialities, race, gender, class, sexuality, labor, toxic geeks, cyberfeminisms, trolls, glitter, cuteness, Black Twitter, virtual signaling, and many more complex ways we make and are made within digital media culture. In this seminar-style course, we will endeavor to understand how Internet users and cultures express, represent, and gives us an opportunity to consider how identities are made. Two key questions will guide us: How are online selves worn and performed? How do social forces like platforms and communities shape our understanding of online identities?","Murphy,Sheila C",DIGITAL,368,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Internet of Identities,3,,,FTVM/DIGITAL 367.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Studies in Transnational Media,"Narcotrafficking and the U.S./Mexico border have remained at the center of political and cultural debate in the United States for over three decades. These topics have also become staples of the contemporary mediascape, from journalistic reporting to horror films and streaming content.

Introduction to Global Change:  The Science Behind Sustainability," Everyday, human and natural activities are altering the planet on which we live. Through our increasing resource consumption, population growth, disturbance of natural systems, and technological advancement, we are changing the global climate and environment in a manner that is unique over Earth’s history. Many of these changes are degrading the physical and biological processes that underpin Earth’s life-support systems, which poses a great challenge for society in this century.
 This course, Global Change — the Science of Sustainability, investigates the causes and impacts of these changes using a combination of traditional lecture-based and modern digital teaching methodologies. The course surveys the evolution and interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes on Earth; how past changes on Earth help us predict the future, especially with respect to climate change; and how fundamental principles of science establish the sustainability of human activities on Earth. Students apply learned knowledge by using ‘systems modeling’ and spreadsheet software to investigate the dynamics of natural systems and examine case studies of relevant environmental problems.
  The course curriculum provides excellent opportunities to conduct research on topics of interest to the students, culminating in a course project presented at the end of the academic term. The interactive laboratory exercises provide students the opportunity to use software tools to examine how natural systems function as well as develop projections of the future consequences of changes in the environment. And, perhaps most important of all, students will have ample time for discussion of critical issues in natural resources and sustainability, and the role of environmental science in policy and society as a whole. All topics are developed in a manner that students will find both accessible and interesting. After the course, students should be able to discern sound science from biased claims and will have a foundation for making informed decisions about sustainable practices in their own lives.

The first type of material is related to the highly controversial nature of many topics that are covered in lectures. Many students are passionate about many topics from population control to environmental standards to renewable energy to GMOs. Whereas some students are satisfied learning about controversial topics in lecture, others crave the opportunity to research and debate these topics in a small group setting. 
The second type of material utilized in the labs relate to quantitative data sets, calculations and models. Some students are skeptical about conclusions reported by the media related to environmental issues and want to work with ""real"" datasets themselves. These quantitative labs require extensive interaction with fellow students and GSIs. Data from the peer-reviewed literature and government agency websites must be located and evaluated. Simple programming software can also be used to develop simple models of environmental systems.","

Primarily, the course focuses on theories that account for the occurrence of crises from within the system and on theories that explain propagation and amplification mechanisms of otherwise weak external shocks. The course is mostly theory-oriented supported with a real-life narrative.","Dudek,Maciej Konrad",ECON,396,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Economics of Crises,3,,,Students with first year or sophomore standing should complete ECON 102 (with a C or higher) before taking ECON 402.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Strategy,"In this course you will learn how to describe and analyze environments where decision-makers act strategically; namely, situations where computing one's own best decision is based on information about the behavior of others. Analyzing these strategic interactions will allow us to develop unique insights into many real-world situations including business decisions, voting, bargaining, etc. ","Peralta,Esteban",ECON,398,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, SS",,ECON 102 (unless ECON 101 completed with B or higher).,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Intermediate Microeconomic Theory,"Microeconomic theory models the behavior of individuals and firms, and the properties of markets in which they interact. It provides foundations for current economic research, and for evaluating economic policies. We will focus less on idealized markets with perfect competition, without externalities, and without information frictions; we will focus more on markets that fall short of those ideal conditions. The course is organized around two key frameworks: classical demand theory, which addresses how individual preferences and constraints lead to aggregate demand behavior; and game theory, which addresses how strategic economic agents make decisions in environments where their actions are interdependent. Smaller portions of the course focus on theories of monopoly optimization and perfect competition. We cover economic policy issues related to collusion, insurance, pollution, platform monopolies (like Facebook and Google), and consumer finance. By learning to solve optimization problems using calculus, we will gain a better understanding of both economics and calculus. In-class questions will reinforce your learning, and in-class activities will help illustrate the concepts. We don't follow a textbook closely, so lecture slides, practice exams, and other materials will be distributed on the course website.","Miller, David  ",ECON,401,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, QR/1",,ECON 101 and 102.,"F, W, Sp.",May not be repeated for credit.,
Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory,"This course in Macroeconomics deals with the determination of broad economic aggregates such as national income, employment, the price level, and the Balance of Payments in both the short run and the long run. Aspects of the micro-foundations of Macroeconomics will also be presented.

International Trade Theory,"This course is an introduction to the study of international trade. International trade is central to understanding the growth and evolution of the international economy, from the “first globalization” of the nineteenth century to the “second globalization” that we continue to experience today. In this course, we will seek to understand the causes and consequences of these monumental changes in the world economy through a study of the fundamental economic determinants of the pattern of trade among nations. We begin by examining the classical theories of trade due to differences in productivity or factor endowments. We then extend our inquiry to the role of firms and imperfect competition in trade, including multinational enterprises and international supply chains, crucial elements of the second globalization. The final part of the course examines the theory and empirics of trade policy, paying close attention to how trade and trade policy affect the development process of developing countries. We will also analyze issues of contemporary interest (such as the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit) using the tools developed in the course.","Bartelme,Dominick Gabriel",ECON,441,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Microeconomics,"What role should governments play in the economy? We will review the conditions under which free markets lead to Pareto efficient outcomes — i.e., the government has no way to make everyone better off. We will then discuss how governments may want to intervene to correct market failures. Even when markets lead to efficient outcomes, we will study why they may use imperfect tools such as taxes to change how outcomes like income are distributed between individuals and groups. The aim of the course is to foster an understanding of the tools required to analyze and evaluate government policies, and develop the student’s ability to communicate the conclusions of their analysis to different audiences.

Introduction to Education:  Schooling and Multicultural Society,"This course argues that education affects the lives of everyone in U.S. society and that Michigan students can benefit from a close examination of how race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and class shape schooling
in this culture. Discussions in this class are not always comfortable because the topics are difficult ones, but students routinely claim that taking this course has been a transformative experience. When we
discuss today’s patterns of school funding, the effects of racism are immediately evident, and they take
on historical context when we consider the gendered schooling of the Colonial Period, the denial of
literacy to African Americans during the era of slavery, the powerful anti-Catholic sentiments that led
to the creation of a system of Catholic education in the U.S., and the boarding schools which attempted
to expunge the American Indian heritages of children. The historical context offers a somewhat
distanced perspective on racism and ethnicity, along with gender, religion, and class. Accordingly,
students sometimes take refuge in “that was then, this is now” with regard to issues of educational inequality. However, when the course turns to more contemporary issues such as theories of
intelligence based on race or assumptions made about students of Arabic descent or the experiences of
female students in math and science, it becomes more difficult to deny the ways that race or ethnicity or
gender contribute to inequality in education. Comparisons extend across time as well as across
populations. For example, learning about the recent increase in school-age immigrants and the
experiences of English language learners gives students a point of comparison with the role schooling
played in the lives of late 19th-century immigrants. Similarly, considering the educational challenged faced by American Indians and Latinos in today’s schools provides a synchronous comparative
experience. Overall, then, this course gives students multiple opportunities to consider the meaning of
race and ethnicity, to explore the various forms of inequality engendered by intolerance, and to compare
discrimination as it is enacted in response to many forms of difference.","Seeber,Emily",EDUC,118,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,RE,,,(non-LSA).,May not be repeated for credit.,
Video Games and Learning,"Why are videogames fun?  The answer isn't as obvious as you might think.  Good games draw you in, teach you how to succeed, and keep you engaged with a ""just right"" level of challenge.  Most importantly, players *learn* while playing a well-designed game.  Why isn't school like that?

Web Based Mentorship:  Learning Through Character Play,"Overview
This seminar revolves around Place Out Of Time (POOT), a web-based character-playing
simulation involving college, high school, and middle school students. You will have a
dual role in the simulation: you will play a character yourself, and you will also act as a
project leader and mentor to the younger participants.

POOT is run in cooperation with the Center for Middle Eastern and North African
Studies and the School of Education at UM-Flint. The core of the simulation is anchored
in the years 711 through 1492 and the cultures in and around what was known as Muslim
Spain, or “al-andalus.” However, the simulation draws from all periods of history and all
world cultures. The simulation revolves around a trial - different each time the simulation
is run -- based on events and people from history. While the details are everchanging,
timeless and universal themes, such as ""identity,"" ""freedom,"" and ""security,""
are the backdrop for POOT.

This class is different because you are responsible not just for your own learning, but for
the learning of younger peers who are depending on you. In order to fulfill that
responsibility, though, you will (collectively) need to understand and articulate a variety
of cultural and historical perspectives, as filtered through the personalities that appear in
the simulation. We have chosen to utilize character-playing simulation for two reasons.
First, we see great value in character playing as an exercise of the imagination. Being
forced to “walk in the shoes” of another, and to consider the ideas and the perspective of
someone from another time or place, can be a powerful catalyst to learning. Secondly,
both you and the student participants will be asked to do this character playing in a taskoriented
way. Mentors and students will learn about their character’s lives, their points of 
view, and the societal contexts in which their characters lived. You will then be
presented with a contemporary problem, which you will consider from the perspective of
your character. The idea is to help the students to construct a bridge between historical
times and the present day, to gain a heightened appreciation for other worldviews, and to wrestle with some (hopefully) interesting questions in a way that will deepen our learning
about history…and about ourselves.
It is often said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. To that, one might add
that the next best way to learn something is to play a game with it. This class tries to
combine both of those methods.","Stanzler, Jeff  ",EDUC,462,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,Experiential,,,May be repeated for credit.,
Web Based Mentorship:  Arab-Israeli Conflict Simulation,"This class is based on a computer-mediated simulation that engages middle school and high school students in exploring the Arab-Israeli Conflict through participating in it themselves. Students in high schools in Michigan, elsewhere in the US, and even outside the U.S. could be interacting with one another, and with you, over the course of the term. University student ""mentors"" (that's you) facilitate this diplomatic simulation (in which we create a scenario that becomes the ""reality"" of our world) and serve as gatekeepers, pushing the students to act in ways that are in keeping with the beliefs/constraints that the person they are portraying would hold and operate under. There is a complex structure in place for them to communicate with others, to issue press releases and otherwise express their interests and trade influence, and finally to introduce possible new actions into the simulated world. All of this is done with the support and with the assistance of the mentors.

Fundamentally, the exercise is an attempt to give students a tangible window into the diplomatic process, with it's slow, thorny inner-workings. This course, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (AIC) simulation itself, are based on the idea that the most meaningful learning often happens when one is actively engaged in a purposeful activity. By participating in AIC as a mentor, we hope that you will get a chance to think deeply about (among other things) how people learn to take diverse perspectives, what it takes to foster thoughtful discourse, and the nature of diplomacy itself.

AIC is also a project in the School of Education, and part of its purpose is to develop new ways that technology can support meaningful learning experiences with high school students. Within the context of the seminar, then, we start with a basic grounding in the history of the conflict, and then move on to figuring out how to let that grounding inform your ongoing efforts to both support and challenge the student participants.","Stanzler, Jeff  ",EDUC,463,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,

Advanced Topics in Biology," This field course will be held at the UM Biological Station (UMBS) in second half of August 2021 prior to the start of the Fall 2021 term. For additional information on the field course, including specific dates, please see the UMBS link.
This project-based course will emulate how scientists study environmental microbes in the context of real-world sustainability issues in Northern Michigan—while making novel scientific contributions. The course goals include the mastery of methods needed to sample and study the community and functional diversity of freshwater microbes and their viruses. The students will gain experience developing research questions and hypotheses, applying both classic and state-of-the-art techniques in microbiology, and communicating their results to (i) build their microbial methods tool-set to ask deeper and more specific questions and (ii) increase competitiveness for future academic and professional pursuits.
At the start of the UMBS course, students will gain exposure to water microbe-relevant sustainability issues in Northern Michigan with local partners (wastershed councils, managers, citizen science groups), answering: “What are the real world issues?” Simultaneously, students will master microbiological concepts and skills needed for field sample collection and analysis, answering: “How could we rigorously address those issues?” The first week will be devoted to student project development, e.g., hypothesis generation and study design. Between the first and second weeks, students will spend two nights on Lake Michigan in a tall-masted schooner to learn, e.g., how to work on a research vessel, sampling equipment and collection, navigation, and the science of regional ecosystem monitoring programs. The second week will be devoted to student project development, continued sample collection as needed, data analysis, and preserving the projects until the on-campus course component begins. Students will master: field sampling techniques for the collection of microbes and their viruses in both the water column and sediment, fluorescent microscopy of microbes and viruses, development of enrichment cultures targeting specific microbial metabolisms, isolation of environmental microbes and viruses, nucleic acids extractions, and concepts of community
genomics (actual analysis to be performed in fall term on campus).

Mathematical Ecology,"

The study of ecology is the study of complex systems that are intrinsically dynamic and quantitative. Ecologists formulate mathematical models to describe this complexity; the equations that result are interesting both for their biological predictions and their mathematical form. Full analytical solution of model equations is typically impossible, yet to the mathematically prepared mind, they can yield up their secrets.

This course is intended to provide students with the tools needed to formulate and analyze ecological models. It is an overview of the major categories of models and the mathematical techniques available for their analysis.  Although the focus is on ecological dynamics, students in other disciplines will find the methods readily applicable to their own fields.Course Requirements:The course presumes mathematical maturity at the level of advanced calculus with prior exposure to ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and probability.","King, Aaron A",EEB,466,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"MATH 217, 417, or 419; MATH 256, 286, or 316; and MATH 450 or 451.",,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Introduction to Computer Organization,"Course Overview
This course is intended to give you a basic understanding of how computers execute programs. Understanding computers means understanding the hardware/software process of how you and the computer work together to have the computer carry out a concept. In your introductory programming courses (e.g. EECS 280), you learned how to express a concept in terms of a high-level programming language such as C/C++. In EECS 370, you will see how a low-level language is executed by the hardware, and you will see how to put together basic, hardware building blocks to form the functional units of a computer. 
To achieve these goals, you will design and ""build"" simple computers at various levels of detail. In this course, building will not mean connecting chips and gates. Rather, you will describe the hardware in diagrams, finite-state machines, and hardware simulators (written in C). To further your understanding of other topics, we will provide practice questions that will be discussed in the discussion sections. 

Prerequisites
Students must have taken EECS 280. Depending on when you took EECS 280, you may not yet be familiar with programming C on Unix. We advise you to learn quickly. A brief overview of C vs. C++ will occur during the first discussion section of the semester. Also you can go to GSI office hours for additional help. 

Course Material
The required text for the course is Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface (3rd edition), by Patterson and Hennessy. The lecture notes are posted on the course web page. 

Class Projects
Four projects will be assigned during the term, each of which will require a substantial time commitment on your part. Many students find the work load in this course to be heavy. 
Grading policy
Final grades will be based on the total points earned on the projects and exams. Factors such as class participation may be used to adjust your final grade, especially if it falls on a borderline. The tentative point breakdown is as follows: 

Projects 10% each = 40% 

Homework (4 assignments) = 5% 

Exams 2 midterms, 15% each, 1 final 25% = 55%

Computer Architecture,"Class Overview 

EECS 470 is an introductory graduate-level course in computer architecture. This course is intended to do two things: to give you a solid, detailed understanding of how computers are designed and implemented, including the central processor and memory and I/O interfaces; and to make you aware of the numerous tradeoffs in design and implementation, their interaction, their realization in both historical and state-of-the-art systems, and trends that will affect them in future systems. We will cover instruction set architectures, pipelining (including basic pipelining, multiple-instruction-per-cycle machines, out-of-order instruction execution, and vector processing), memory systems (including caches and virtual memory), I/O interfaces, operating system issues, and basic multiprocessor systems. We will also do case studies on microprocessors and systems you may have used, perhaps including the P6 (Pentium Pro/II/III), Pentium 4, and the Sony PlayStation/2. 
A central part of EECS 470 is the detailed design of major portions of a substantial processor using the Verilog hardware design language (HDL). Portions of this work will be done individually as homeworks; the bulk of the work will be done in groups of three to five as a term project. You will use modern commercial CAD tools to develop your design. This project represents a significant investment of time on your part, and is a significant portion of your grade in this class. However, in computer architecture it is particularly true that ""the devil is in the details,"" and you will gain important experience and knowledge by coming face to face with that devil.

Academic Writing and Literature,"What comes into your mind when you hear the word “medieval”? Beyond the chivalric motifs of castles, knights, and damsels in distress, the Middle Ages can also evoke images of violence, the Crusades, and the idea of a “Dark Age.” To understand how the period has come to bear such a multiplicity of meaning, we have to go back to the source.  In this writing-intensive course, we will focus on creating complex, well-supported arguments. We will focus on the intersection between critical thinking and persuasive writing, using literary texts from and about the Middle Ages as our point of reference. We will examine (some of) the ways the people of the Middle Ages viewed themselves, and, by contrast, examine our own definitions of “medieval.”  Working closely with peers and the instructor,  we will develop our writing through workshops and extensive revision and editing. We will learn to read medievalisms (both in texts and in images/iconographies) through the context of their own period and to identify what purpose(s) they serve.

Academic Writing and Literature,"In this section of English 124, we will examine literature through the lens of the arts (broadly conceived as painting, sculpture, photography, music, film, dance, design, websites, games, and other media and entertainment). In glimpsing into literature, we will analyze writing about art, or ekphrasis, interpreting the ways in which writers have portrayed visual images or representations of art in poetry and short stories from the past and present. We will also consider literature as an art form, one that can evoke qualities and reactions such as beauty, wonder, rapture, or sympathy – or their opposites; that can invite or inspire appreciation, interpretation, response, creation, and action. Expanding our conception of ‘texts’ to encompass cultural artifacts and media, we will interrogate the boundaries between literature and art. Throughout the course, we will treat writing as an art, a craft carefully developed through revision and reflection. Questions to investigate include: In what ways can we trace patterns or images in a text? In what ways can we glean insights into the deeper meanings of literary works through a close examination of language, motifs, symbols, and other devices? What is the larger significance of the texts we read and write?

Academic Writing and Literature,"In his essay, Projective Verse , Charles Olsen called for poets to consider the “open field:” to see patterns and formal qualities of poetry as responsive, rather than conventional, and to envision the poem as a physical site of action, in which form and structure respond to the needs of the poet, subject, and audience. This section of English 124 will investigate the poem as a site of meaning-making and linguistic transformation, or what William Carlos Williams described as “a field of action.”  In this class, our weekly readings will include some representative works from a range of poets including Rilke, Walt Whitman, H.D., Jack Spicer, Robert Duncan, and Denise Levertov, and critical essays from a range of poetic scholars, including Stéphane Mallarmé, Federico Garcia Lorca, and Aimé Césaire, among others. Our intensive, semester-long investigation of open field poetics is intended as a space for you to engage with academic composing practices (reading, writing, revising, research, and so on) in ways that support scholarly curiosity and inquiry, as well as engagement with writing as a collaborative, experiential, and innovative process. Together, we will explore questions about language and poetry such as: What is the role of the poet? What are their responsibilities? What possibilities can poetry as a ‘site of action’ offer? What  is language (and what does it “do”?) How do we interpret texts, and what makes an interpretation meaningful?

We will consider questions of self-representation, asking how authors choose to represent themselves and to what ends. We will engage with questions of identity, and what we mean when we use that word. We will think deeply about the relationship between an individual and a community, an individual and family, and an individual and history. Topics of discussion will include, but are not limited to, matters of race, gender, sexuality, social media, influencers, narrative, and myth. Readings will include memoirs, personal essays, graphic memoir, and scholarly essays by Harriet Jacobs, Sui Sin Far, W.E.B.

Academic Writing and Literature,"This writing class is geared towards students with a strong interest in literature and the humanities. The course draws its readings from canonical 19th- and 20th- century poetry, and its unifying themes from T.S. Eliot’s long poem The Waste Land (1922).  The Waste Land is a major work of Modernist literature, and a touchstone for twentieth- and twenty-first-century literature. But why this poem in particular? Because The Waste Land is like a puzzle. At first reading, it seems inscrutable, throwing one strange “fragment” after another at us readers, and asking us to piece it together, with only a few hints and clues to guide us. However, after closer reading, it opens up, revealing an intricate network of patterns with seemingly limitless depth. In the five brief sections of The Waste Land, Eliot responds to, references, and even cut-and-pastes from texts throughout the history of Western culture, and beyond. Eliot’s poem “speaks” to every other text we read this semester, and they, in turn, “speak” to it. And with its modern mythology of sickness, sacrifice, and renewal, The Waste Land speaks directly to our own troubled times.

Academic Writing and Literature,"Sports and professional athletic competitions are (and have been) an essential aspect of society and culture. Athletics are both a means to find individual expression and create social bonds. Sports are also a method of establishing and/or fighting against socio-cultural or political boundaries. Rivalries (UM vs OSU, Liverpool vs Man U, The Patriots vs … everyone, or All Blacks vs Springboks) often inform and shape not only the athletes’, but also the fans’ identities. Athletics are embroiled in doping scandals, questions of social justice or equity, economic debates, and controversies surrounding gender. Sports have become powerful rhetorical positions that structure the way we tell stories about ourselves and our society. In this Writing Seminar, we first read, watch, and analyze stories by and about athletes and the athletic industry. We will ask what sports have to do with economics, international policy, and much more. We will evaluate the role of the individual and the community; inequality and empowerment; argument and sentiment; history, and representation in relation to the sporting world. Using narratives, such as Among the Thugs, Once a Runner, or the recent Olympics, we will imagine social identity through other (racial, economic, or gendered) categories. How have sports offered narratives or tools to think through or about the Covid crisis? Why have sports become platforms to support, protest, or even reimagine our communities and identities during quarantine? Each of you will assign a sport or narrative for the class to consider, thus compiling a diverse repertoire of athletic positions. For the research project, students investigate an athletic or sport phenomenon within a community of their choice or relate athletics to outside issues.

Academic Writing and Literature,"Sports and professional athletic competitions are (and have been) an essential aspect of society and culture. Athletics are both a means to find individual expression and create social bonds. Sports are also a method of establishing and/or fighting against socio-cultural or political boundaries. Rivalries (UM vs OSU, Liverpool vs Man U, The Patriots vs … everyone, or All Blacks vs Springboks) often inform and shape not only the athletes’, but also the fans’ identities.

Academic Writing and Literature,"“What is time anymore?!” “In these challenging times…” “The time of coronavirus…” The last two years have left many of us feeling temporally topsy-turvy. For this reason, this semester seems like a good moment to investigate our experience of time and the ways this experience is represented in literary fiction. Travelers leaping from one century to another, bewildered characters stuck in temporal loops, threatening and unpredictable clocks—in one way or another, writers working in a wide range of genres love messing with time. In this course, we’ll engage with texts from the nineteenth century to the present that feature weird encounters with time in order to examine how stories organize and try to make sense of temporal experiences. We’ll explore how writers use narratives of the past or future to negotiate the present and we’ll delve into the ways representations of power, agency, and identity are entwined with temporal ruptures, narrative loops, and feelings of being too late, too early, or out of step with the prevailing tempo.","Strout,Laura",ENGLISH,124,"Fall 2021, ",Section 018, - Stories about Time,4,FYWR,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Academic Writing and Literature,"Our class will survey the “castaway tale” as it appears in novels, short stories, plays, nonfiction, film and even New Yorker cartoons. We will trace the lineage of the castaway through connections to colonial ideology, piracy and the history of maritime travel and trade. The course spans from the late 17th and early 18th century to contemporary times, questioning why the castaway trope has acquired such staying power in the cultural and literary imagination. Our reading list is still in the works, but will include a few of the following texts: Robinson Crusoe (1719), The Female American (1767), The Isle of Pines (1668), Gulliver’s Travels (1726), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896),The Mysterious Island (1875), Friday; or, The Other Island (1967), Lord of The Flies (1954), Concrete Island (1974), The Martian (2011).

Academic Writing and Literature,"This writing course focuses on the creation of complex, analytic, well-supported arguments that matter in academic courses. In this particular section, we will develop the fundamental skills for academic writing through a sustained exploration of one particular genre: the hard-boiled detective story, which subordinates the mystery itself to the (usually violent) investigations of the main character. Emerging from the inexpensive pages of pulp magazines, this genre and its cynical pro(?)tagonists enjoyed such popularity that now a handful of its common images—cigarette smoke rising under a street lamp, a detective’s name etched onto a door, a fedora in the rain—can turn a scene into parody or homage. After reading texts by the most influential writers of these stories, including Carroll John Daly, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler, we will turn toward more recent authors who deploy hard-boiled conventions in bold and innovative ways. We will explore how these later novels and short stories interrogate issues that the genre’s pioneers tend to treat uncritically and insensitively, such as race, class, and gender. This course will also examine how hard-boiled fiction has been adapted to other media, both at the height of the genre’s popularity and now.","Williams,David",ENGLISH,124,"Fall 2021, ",Section 020, - The Hard-Boiled Detective Story,4,FYWR,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Academic Writing and Literature,"What can poetry, whose root poïesis means “to make, to do,”  do? What role does writing play in representing, interpreting, and even refashioning our world(s)? From Chaucer’s bawdy Wife of Bath to the visionary Julian of Norwich, biblical worlds to Arthurian lore, we will examine the roles written narrative plays in society — as entertainment, instruction, revelation, and constructor of identity (among other guises). With an understanding of historical moments seemingly distant from our own, we can interrogate where we find remnants of the past in the present — how might these experiences be vastly unfamiliar or hauntingly proximate to ours? Our exploration of earlier writers’ works will serve as a launching point for considerations of how we think critically about our world(s) and ideas, what our writing is capable of as forms of exposition and argumentation, and the complexities that abound in these analyses and expressions.","Owada,Sydney",ENGLISH,124,"Fall 2021, ",Section 021, - Writing Our World(s),4,FYWR,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Academic Writing and Literature,"The past few years have placed divisions—political, cultural, economic, racial, and more—at the forefront of our national consciousness. To be divided, though, requires imagining a larger whole that has fractured, and implies that smaller groups have formed from the pieces. In this class we will explore what it means to belong—or not—to a subgroup, or to the mainstream, the larger whole. How are these communities constructed and maintained? How does one come to be included, to assimilate, and even to police the boundaries of their group? And what about those at the margins, between groups, or with each foot in a different world? Together, we will explore how writers represent the struggle to belong, to find one’s place in the world, and how they make arguments—implicit and explicit—about inclusion and exclusion. We will learn to ask effective questions about a piece of writing, and to formulate arguments which not only take note of the complexities of a text but which make clear the importance of attending to and analyzing these details. This class will engage with a diverse body of work, including poetry, short stories, novels, and film; together we will have conversations about difficult topics including gender, race, immigration, and more. Some of the voices we may encounter include those of Gloria Anzaldúa, Franny Choi, John Clare, Eduardo Corral, Cathy Park Hong, Jhumpa Lahiri, Marilynne Robinson, Zadie Smith, and William Wordsworth.

Their hyperfixation on normal social interactions allows the reader to question and challenge what is considered normal in our contemporary culture. Instead of spectacularizing violence or treating abuses of power as discrete events, these novels portray power and control in the form of ""slow violence""—the boring non-events that perpetuate systemic inequality. The primary genre we will look at is dystopian novels, specifically those that dwell in inaction, boredom, and emotional fatigue. We will also incorporate secondary readings on race, class, gender, and sexuality in order to build frameworks that help our understanding of the texts at hand.

Writing and Academic Inquiry," Learning to craft effective arguments begins with asking important questions.  So this semester, we’ll focus on a question central to your time at Michigan: What’s college for?  In our readings, discussions, and essays, we’ll look at how students, teachers, and writers have answered that question across American history.  There are more ways to answer our driving question than there are people who have asked it, so we’ll see how the answer can vary with time, place, person, and institution.  By the end of the semester, you’ll have begun to formulate your own answer—and to understand a little better what your goals are for the next four years at Michigan and how you might be able to accomplish them.

Writing and Academic Inquiry,"Our course title, ""Everything Is in the Language We Use,"" takes its quoted text from contemporary Ogala Lakota poet Layli Long Soldier, who writes: “Everything is in the language we use.” In this course, we will listen to, pay attention to, and interrogate ideas about language. Throughout the term, we will examine language as power, language as ideology in the world, and the living language(s) of our own communities. It is my goal for this course that we not only grow as academic writers, but also as critical, conscientious listeners of our local and global communities. How does writing urge us to listen and pay attention to the worlds both within and around us? How can we use writing as a tool to further listen to, challenge, and expand our ideas — both within and beyond academia? In practicing writing, we also practice communication, reflection, context evaluation, and, hopefully, empathy (in addition to many other skills). Because of this, we’ll be examining and discussing “texts” and media from a variety of styles and sources, and I will also occasionally ask you to bring in examples from other classes, interests, and/or your personal lives. We will think about the power and production of language, and we will grow our understanding of language by participating in a community of readers.

Writing and Academic Inquiry,"You know what real audiences don’t want to read? Five paragraph essays. You know what they do want to read? Work that’s surprising, intriguing, disturbing. Work that's weird, like an academic essay which somehow links British political slogans, beer ads, the TV show 24, and the (anti-)truth of racial stereotypes. Or an oddly earnest essay about the moral and cultural conflicts surrounding erotic Rick and Morty fanart. Or the story of Roxanne Gay’s surprise obsession with the Sweet Valley High books. (All of which are on the docket for this semester.) In other words, this is a class about how to be writers who reveal the innards of what’s weird about our world and ourselves.","Tessier,Randall L",ENGLISH,125,"Fall 2021, ",Section 058,,4,FYWR,,,"F, W, Sp, Su.",May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

You will learn to trust your own critical thinking and judgment as you ascertain the needs of the assignments and their audiences.

We will consider argumentation from multiple angles, thinking about how the structure and form of our arguments need to change based on who we’re trying to persuade. We will study fields and topics such as contemporary racial justice, science, and technology studies, disability justice, and intersectional feminism in order to understand how writers before us have advocated for themselves and on behalf of their communities. As an introductory course to self-advocacy, we will think expansively about how to use writing and argumentation to achieve desired ends, using a variety of methods and sources.

First-Year Seminar on English Language and Literature,"Many people spoke for – and against – woman’s right to vote in the United States. These speeches are terrific opportunities to understand how activists argue for an absolutely fundamental civil right. They also show us how even progressive activists sometimes rely on conservative ideas in their paths to social change. Let’s look together at the slippery boundaries between binaries such as inclusion and exclusion, progressive and conservative, and also seemingly self-evident identities like “woman,” “white,” “healthy,” and “middle-class.” Sure, these speeches led to the 19th Amendment. What else did these speeches do, and undo?

Maybe you felt, as the student in Hughes’ poem does, that rather than you expressing you, culture norms or history was writing you?","White,Gillian Cahill",ENGLISH,140,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004," - Contemporary American Poetry and ""the Personal""",3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

In this course, we will take these questions seriously but we won’t treat them as timeless: instead, we will view interest in the meaning and meaningfulness of life as a historical phenomenon, one that took off in the late-nineteenth century. We will look especially to British novels from this period to understand why this was the case, and to ask why the novel itself became a key site for thinking about meaning.

The Art of the Story,"Humans have been called story-telling animals. Indeed, from our earliest entrance into the language as young children, we have all been enthralled, inspired, and instructed by stories. And for good reason: narrative forms provide us with potent and versatile tools for ordering and preserving our often unruly experience of the world. In Art of the Story, we explore the cognitive and developmental foundations of our collective addiction to narrative and its role not only in the evolution of literary genres but also in the practice of professions from journalism, health, and law to business and public policy.","Porter,David L",ENGLISH,150,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Why Stories Matter,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Introduction to Language and Rhetoric,"Trolling. Disinformation campaigns. Ad hominem attacks. Gaslighting. Obfuscation and pedantry. These things, and more, are modes of address that have come to typify popular representations of social media discourse. In this class, we’ll examine the theory and practice of bullshit as it relates to digital rhetoric and online circulation. Among other questions, we’ll consider how and where manipulation, truth, and ethos mediate what we popularly describe or understand as bullshit. We’ll think together about how complex appeals to lived experience and alternative data circulate among certain communities of practice online, with particular attention paid to anti-vaccination discourse. We’ll not only examine what it means to argue on the interwebs, but we’ll also ask what it means to imagine digital rhetorical practices that center on questions of ethics, justice, and power.","Yergeau, M Remi  ",ENGLISH,203,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Bullshit and Digital Rhetoric,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).  ,

Introduction to Short Story and Novel,"It is often remarked that human beings are essentially storytellers. One might also observe that most of our stories are short. From the myths and legends of oral traditions, to the invention of modern short fiction in the nineteenth century, to today’s movies or episodes of Black Mirror, it seems that we are attracted to stories that can be consumed in two hours or less. Perhaps this is because, as Edgar Allen Poe suggested in 1842, a story longer than that risks weakening “the immense force derivable from totality.” Unlike the novel – which is permitted to ramble, digress, and constantly expand – the short story must condense the action of the tale, producing a narrative compression usually focused on a single situation and/or character. Like novels, short stories are interested in characters’ inner lives and can nurture a sense of realism, but they must use prose in a poetic manner. Every word counts. In this course, we will survey the history of the short story from the nineteenth century to our own present age – from Hawthorne to Ha Jin – considering form as well as content and examining key aesthetic movements that push the genre forward.","Lyons,Scott Richard",ENGLISH,230,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Art of the Short Story,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Introduction to Visual Culture,"In his introduction to The Matter of Images, Richard Dyer argues that, “how social groups are treated in cultural representation is part and parcel of how they are treated in life, that poverty, harassment, self-hate, and discrimination … are shored up and instituted by representation.” (1). Images are embedded with arguments about national identity and the social body. In this course, we’ll construct a vocabulary for reading images, and consider how the representation of different racial and ethnic groups shapes important cultural narratives. We’ll look at a few key historical moments when those narratives were in formation, and issues of representation were hotly debated. In this course, you will build a vocabulary for reading images, develop a critical awareness of the ways in which images matter, and develop strategies for critically responding to images and their contexts. Readings include Nicholas Mirzoeff, Susan Sontag, Richard Dyer, and Nell Irvin Painter.","Nichols,Dana",ENGLISH,232,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Race and Visual Culture,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

In surveying a diverse and distinct body of American writing, we will seek to define our own taxonomy of what “American literature” entails and represents. We’ll discuss the formal and thematic issues we assume American literature will feature, whether those elements really hold true over the course of the work we’ll study together, how the texts speak to one another, and, most importantly, how these unique works create their own visions of America.","Habash,Gabe",ENGLISH,270,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - American Dreams & Realities,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

We will do literary close readings of texts to think through many of the issues relating to the development of an African American literary tradition. What constitutes a tradition? Can there be more than one? Along with these questions, we will examine our own assumptions about this literature and the many ways in which these texts reflect the different experiences of African Americans intent on gaining a national voice in a slaveholding and racially polarized nation.","Santamarina,Xiomara A",ENGLISH,274,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,AAS 111 (CAAS 111).,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

To do this we will read literature by European American, African American, Native American, Chinese American Latinx American, and Arab American writers—eight books plus some poems and short stories. Interspersed among literary texts will be several readings about theories and measures of happiness, along with music, art, film/TV, and, especially, advertising that focuses on happiness.","Gere,Anne Ruggles",ENGLISH,290,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - The Pursuit of Happiness,3,"RE, HU",,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,With permission of instructor.

Great Works,"Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale has enjoyed an impressive afterlife in graphic and screen adaptations, in the publication of a sequel, and of course, on English and Women’s Studies syllabuses. This course will investigate The Handmaid’s Tale as a relic of our time, from the punky and Reaganomical 1980s through our own postgenderist and race-critical moment; we will also study the cultural commentary offered through both an outstanding graphic adaptation and a sequel novel. (The acclaimed Netflix serial will be regularly introduced into class discussions, but will not be required for independent study outside class meetings.) As a two-credit mini-course, we will meet over the first half of the fall semester for 2-hour meetings on both Tuesdays and Thursdays, starting 9/2 and ending 10/14/21.

Introduction to Literary Studies,"This course will explore the value of studying literature both for its own sake and for what it can tell us about the history, culture, and politics of nations. The leading question will be an ethical one: what value can be placed on interpretations of fictional works? But we will also ask other questions such as: how do we understand the ideological work of literature? What is the purpose of literary interpretation? How should we, as readers, deal with the author’s intentions and the actions of their characters? And to what extent should we look outside literary works to decide on their value?","Hartley,Lucy",ENGLISH,298,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - What's the value?

How does the travel narrative specially stage encounters of self and other? How does travel especially bring together matters of personal development and mortality with the socio-politics of empire? How does travel narrative illuminate refugee experience and the “wrongs” of tourism? A couple of our texts were written in the early 20th century (the early 1900s), a few written in more recent times, and their settings range across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean; we will study socio-historical and biographical contexts to better understand our reading as well as consider issues of genre and form.

Introduction to Literary Studies,"From memes to novels to celebrity life, relatability has become a catch-all cliché in the modern world both online and off. In this course we’ll be looking at the particular challenges and benefits of the “relateable” lens: what lives or experiences or narratives get to be judged relatable, and why? Can one “relate” to a medieval poem or slave narrative if relatability is merely a synonym for identification? Can we, in other words, relate to texts, people, characters, that are totally unlike ourselves? Questions of relatability have undoubtedly amplified some voices at the expense of others, exposing the extent to which the “relatable” may be defined by a particular (white, straight, male) subject position. However, questions of relatability can also be applied to a wide-ranging group of texts that may have nothing to do with the reader’s own personal, lived experience. Over the course of the semester we will ask whether it’s possible—and if so how and to what extent—we can relate to, and learn in, a community of people and texts that are not like us.","Gwin, Lauren  ",ENGLISH,298,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004,,3,HU,,,Prerequisite for the English major and English Honors Plan.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Introduction to Literary Studies,"In this course we will explore the issues, characteristics and methods of literary study. What does it mean to do “literary” study? We will explore a variety of texts, including poetry, short fiction, novels and plays to develop close reading and critical writing skills, and to familiarize ourselves with the different interpretive methods we use when we read. Our readings will focus, in particular, on the long Western literary tradition of vilifying characters of African descent, using Shakepeare’s play as a springboard into US texts from the past and today that struggle with this “problem.”","Santamarina,Xiomara A",ENGLISH,298,"Fall 2021, ",Section 005, - Shakespeare's Caliban and His Cousins,3,"RE, HU",,,Prerequisite for the English major and English Honors Plan.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Directed Study,"As a privilege for students who have displayed academic excellence and who can show appropriate preparation in courses previously taken, the Department of English offers course credit for independent study. Independent study provides an opportunity for highly motivated and capable students to pursue a rigorous course of study that is not accommodated elsewhere in the curriculum.

Independent study proposals require advance planning. Each must be developed in consultation with a full-time member of the English Department faculty who will serve as a faculty mentor for the project, and subsequently must be approved by the Undergraduate Chair of the Department. Interested students should begin consulting with their mentors during the semester before the proposed independent study in order to develop a feasible course. Only those proposing a carefully structured and intellectually viable course of study that is not already offered in the undergraduate curriculum should submit applications. Independent study requires that students design their own courses, create their own syllabi, and work closely with faculty mentors. Supervising professors must donate a great deal of time and effort, so students applying for independent study should be similarly committed to the project. Students must be in residence in order to undertake independent study projects. A three-credit independent study should involve at least one hour of student-faculty contact plus an additional eight hours of work per week. It is also possible to elect two or four credit hours with appropriate changes in workload.

Professors normally do not supervise independent studies during terms when they are on leave, nor do they supervise them on subjects which fall outside of their areas of specialization, or on subjects covered by regular course offerings. A limit of six credit hours of independent study may be accumulated in the English department. Independent study projects cannot be used to fulfill Department program requirements or College distribution requirements.
To apply:

Pick up an Independent Study Application at the English Department office at 3187 Angell Hall. 
Complete Part I of the independent study application and attach a statement addressing each of the questions posed there along with a copy of your transcript.
Part II of the application must be completed by the supervising faculty member. 
Submit both parts of this proposal to the Undergraduate Secretary in 3187 Angell Hall. 


Once a decision is made regarding your proposal, you will be notified either by phone or by email.

Our main task will be to understand something of sounds, words, and structure of English at each of these earlier periods, but especially we will work to understand why and how a language changes (or doesn't).

Beginning with the legacy of Puritanism, we shall turn to other varieties of evil in the nation’s past as they touch upon issues relating to slavery, inequality, and other forms of injustice.","Larson,Kerry C",ENGLISH,313,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Evil and the American Literary Imagination,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Women and Literature,"In this course, we will consider both idealized and misogynist depictions of women as characters in Middle English texts as well as the often complicated ways these stereotyped portrayals relate to one another. We will also study women as writers; among our course texts will be the first two books known to be written in English by women. Several of our readings will be religious, including some truly surprising miracles of the Virgin Mary, and stories of tenacious and daring female martyrs. But we will study a number of secular texts, too, including a poem about a woman who brews beer and stories featuring witches.

By reading the refugee experience across the 20th and 21st centuries, this course offers undergraduate students with diverse interests an opportunity to rethink some of the most important concepts in contemporary life: security, humanity, the human, the state, race, class, and the global. In addition, it will also provide a strong grounding in past and contemporary global literature.","Bakara,Hadji",ENGLISH,317,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Literature of the Refugee,3,"RE, HU",,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Literature and Culture,"Revolutionary Theatre is theatre that explores our expectations of what can be done both on and off the stage, that cries out for a world more just than our own, and that models how to work together as equals for the benefit for all. At least, this is the vision held by many theatremakers in the US 1960s, who responded to that decade’s utopian dreams by inventing new strategies to transform the hearts and minds of audiences. Among these strategies was a collective creation, abandoning top-down leadership by a director/playwright in favor of devising work as a group. Other strategies included meeting audiences on the street and in their communities, using “environmental” stage designs, and crafting mythic or expressionist (rather than realist) dramaturgies.","Fitzgerald,Jason",ENGLISH,317,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Revolutionary Theatre: US 1960s Radical Theatre Groups,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Literature and Culture,"The 18th-century Scottish moral philosopher Adam Smith claimed that the true wealth of the nation lay in its culture.  More recent writers have argued that contemporary Scottish politics, including questions about independence, have often been infused with or even driven by cultural activism, and that reading, seeing, hearing, and participating in cultural activity have been ways in which Scottish people think about and act on political issues.
 
In this course, we will explore Scottish cultural activity from the late 19th century to the present—including imagined futures-- through literature of many kinds, visual arts of many kinds, performances of many kinds, music of many kinds, and more.  The material of the course will include drama, film, fiction, poetry, music, landscape works, creative engagements with science and technology, and the visual arts. Students will examine Scottish history through how it has been used and transformed both in canonical works and new, ongoing work.  
 
Cliches and stereotypes of Scotland are easy to describe and to dismiss as inadequate. But we will explore Scottish cultural history not in order to debunk some claims about “Scottishness” or “national identity” and replace them with other claims we like better but to consider how Scottish cultural history itself complicates, multiplies, or refuses such claim-making.Course Requirements:Intended Audience:Students from all majors are welcome and no previous knowledge is assumed.","Israel,Kali A K",ENGLISH,317,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004, - Modern Scottish Culture,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Defining health to include physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, sexual and/or reproductive well-being, we will read key literary works across genres - novels, short stories, essays, poetry, memoir – alongside scholarly articles to shed light on the gendered terrain of health in diverse contexts. We will also attempt to relate the textual material to society, polity, and lived experience. Course themes include, among others, the impact of gender role expectations on emotional and mental health; economic inequalities; immigrant well-being; racial and sexual violence; transgender issues; eating disorders, nutrition; and holistic approaches to health.

Although we will consider a wide range of topics, the two main through-lines will be 1) the topic announced in the course title—social and political hierarchy, with special emphasis on its challengers—and 2) human interactions with other aspects of the natural world—from microbes (the Black Death), through animals both real and supernatural, to climate (the Little Ice Age). How do writers understand our relation both to a repeatedly destabilized social order and to its larger environmental setting, a setting that is partly responsible for that destabilization?","Cohen,Walter I",ENGLISH,317,"Fall 2021, ",Section 006, - Foes of Power,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Genre Studies,"Where my course ENG290 Contemporary Horror focuses mostly on current and popular horror fiction, social media-based horror stories, creepypasta, comics, and film, this course will take a turn towards the literary, and a journey into the past. We will study the classics of the horror genre as well as horror stories that are considered literary classics (overlapping lists to a certain extent: novels such as Beloved, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Turn of the Screw, and others; and films such as The Exorcist and Alien), and as we do, we will consider why horror stories so often lurk in the corners of the canon, occupying marginalized places in it. We will read secondary scholarship addressing the horror stories we study as well as theories of horror. Those who consider horror to be a low-brow genre will be surprised to learn that these secondary readings are incredibly sophisticated, suggesting there is far more to horror than simply being scared.","Brandolino,Gina Marie",ENGLISH,318,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Classic Horror,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,With permission of instructor.

But while the OED describes the “listicle” as a combination of “list + article” invented in 2007, lists are one of the oldest and most enduring literary forms. From early medieval catalog poems like Widsith and Deor to Biblical enumeration to Solmaz Sharif’s “Look,” this class will consider the history of the list as a literary genre. Lists have been used to make political statements, tell stories, craft arguments, reveal injustices, even imagine heaven and hell! By comparing some of the oldest examples with current, contemporary poetry, we will consider the roots of a form we still use every day.","Clark,Amy W",ENGLISH,318,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Listicle Literature: The History of a Form,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,With permission of instructor.

This class is about the politics and literature of visibility in narratives that reveal undocumented lives, as well as the theory of literature as a tool for social justice. The texts we will study illuminate the people and circumstances behind undocumented immigration, the policies that make documentation precarious and out of reach, and the sweeping generalizations and dehumanization behind terms like “illegal alien.”","Anderson,Sigrid Michelle",ENGLISH,319,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Literature of the Undocumented,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

How do they define “environment,” their relation to it, and their place within it? From climate fiction (“cli-fi”) to necropastoral poems and beyond, we will read literary works, as well as academic scholarship and popular writing, that respond to these questions.","Chakraborty,Sumita",ENGLISH,320,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Writing in a Time of Extinction,3,HU,Sustain,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Writing and the Environment,"The hallmark Wilderness Act of 1964 defined wilderness as an area where the Earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain. First-generation environmental writers, sensing the increasing threats to these areas, particularly those most familiar to them, frequently used their writing as a vehicle to essentially “preserve” and share the “untrammeled” place. Second and third-generation environmental writers no longer have that luxury. We live in a world where nature and culture are always in contact. This course examines today’s environmental writing with this relationship in mind. Students will be introduced to the art and practice of environmental writing, with a particular focus on reading and writing the interdisciplinary environmental essay. Through both analysis and practice, students will increase their understanding of the specific traits of this genre, and begin to recognize the traits of the continually forming subgenres, ranging from toxic discourse to interspecies communication to the commodification of the global commons. This in turn will aid students in evaluating not only published writing but peer writing, as they recognize the potential pitfalls and challenges presented by environmental writing, but also when successfully executed, its potential to influence social change.","Karczynski,David Edward",ENGLISH,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Environmental Writing,3,"ULWR, CE",,,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,

Our organizing questions will include the following: How do contemporary novels and poems about the slave past reflect and address our racial present? What is the relationship of historical fiction to history proper, and to the scholarly study of history? How is the literature of historical trauma tied up with questions of moral responsibility, past and present?","Levy-Hussen,Aida",ENGLISH,335,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Contemporary Narratives-Slavery,3,"RE, HU",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Studies in Poetry,"First, let’s acknowledge that it’s not always easy to say what makes a poem queer—but everyone should be able to agree on the fact that some poems are made up of material from the lives and hearts and minds of queer people—in both explicit and implicit ways. Queer love and romance, queer desire and sex, the complexities of gender, gender identity, and gender norms—there’s a whole world of poetry that allows us as readers to see these things in action through the (sometimes strange) performance of language that poetry invites us to witness. And because the mode of witnessing that poetry allows for is different from, say, what we might experience in a documentary mode—or even other literary genres like the fictional or the dramatic—poems can give us a special entry point into discussions of queerness, leading to questions and insights that can be harder to get to with other approaches. When Mark Doty asks, for example, in his book Atlantis, which chronicles his last days living on Cape Cod with his lover Wally, who was dying of AIDS: “What is a description, after all, / but encoded desire?” or when Natalie Diaz, in her Postcolonial Love Poem, writes: “Like any desert, I learn myself by what’s desired of me— / and I am demoned by those desires,” the poetry puts us right in the middle of these two queer poets’ lives, and allows us to ask questions about how desire works in those lives, what desire even is, really, and how it might differ from other, heteronormative ways we’ve understood desire in non-queer texts and spaces.","Knuth, Aric David",ENGLISH,340,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Queer Poetics,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Writing for Publication/Public Writing,"This course aims to give students an introduction to the world of mass media, with a strong emphasis on reporting and writing about the environment and public health. This class has consistently won high praise from students for providing personalized, hands-on training in improving writing skills. Students learn from two prize-winning journalists who have more than 40 years combined experience covering the environment and public health for media outlets such as The New York Times, Newsweek, The Detroit Free Press, and National Public Radio. Each week, the course focuses on a different topic in the news related to the environment or public health, which may include alternative energy, the environmental future of the auto industry, energy efficiency, climate change, environmental justice, garbage, pandemics, or cancer. 

Students hear from a range of leading experts on the topic of the day, learning not only about the subject itself but also about the process of journalism. Guest speakers are chosen to represent many points of view. They range from corporate executives to environmental activists, scientists, government officials, and journalists. Past speakers have included former SNRE Dean Rosina Bierbaum; Donele Wilkins, Executive Director of Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice; State Senator Liz Brater; Zoe Lipman of The National Wildlife Federation; Mike Johnston of the Michigan Manufacturers’ Association; Joe White, The Wall Street Journal’s Detroit Bureau chief; Lester Graham of The Environment Report, a public radio show; and 60 Minutes producer Alden Bourne, among many others. Along the way, instructors lecture and steer discussions about media ethics, interviewing skills, freedom-of-information laws, the Internet as a source of information, government databases, and many other journalism-related topics.

Performance Studies,"How has the canon of western European drama changed in the hands of theatrical practitioners in an age of revision and reinterpretation? Figures like Ibsen and Chekhov retain their status as foundational figures, though their pivotal works have been reimagined in surprising ways by companies like Mabou Mines (Dollhouse) and playwrights like Lucas Hnath (A Doll’s House, Part 2), Aaron Posner (Stupid F**king Bird) and Christopher Durang (Vanya and Sonia and Marsha and Spike), among others. This course is designed to introduce students to the major works of Brecht, Beckett, Strindberg, Pirandello, Wilde, and Shaw in addition to Ibsen and Chekhov, but as it does so it considers such issues as the canon’s resistance to change, the representation of the female figure on stage, the privileged position of male voices, the championing of progressive social and political issues, the transition to film and other video resources, and the creative role today’s world theater plays in establishing a new theatrical idiom for the contemporary stage.","Brater,Enoch",ENGLISH,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - European Drama from Ibesen to Beckett,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,With permission of instructor.

Southern Natures: The Making and Unmaking of Races and Environments in the US South,"In this course, we will explore southern US environmental, racial, and cultural history. We will think about how southern environments have been created, experienced, and turned into narrative and visual art since the colonial period, with an emphasis on the 1840-present period. We’ll think about how notions of racial difference, gradually codified in southern colonies and states beginning around 1700, came to be “naturalized” (with reference to environmental factors like climate), while it was a majority Africa-descended workforce who was carrying out the work of environmental alterations (deforestation, staple cultivation, infrastructure building, etc.). We’ll think both about unequal exposures to environmental harm (a fundamental concern in the Environmental Justice movement), but also about deep traditions of environmental love and affinity across southern communities.


We’ll start with a long unit on Hurricane Katrina, as remembered through the work of filmmakers, mapmakers, visual artists and journalists. Next we’ll look at contemporary plantation (and Civil War) memorialization to consider how the plantation lives on in our built and cultural environments. These first weeks spent looking at the contemporary scene will set up some mysteries for us to solve in the rest of the term: how were these contemporary legacies of the plantation era produced historically? We’ll jump back to Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the States of Virginia (1782) and work our way forward again, through authors and artists like Frederick Douglass, Solomon Northup, Charles Chesnutt, William Faulkner, Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright.


I very much welcome students from across the university to take this class. In past years, students in Engineering, PitE, English, Art & Design and other majors/schools have brought their academic fluencies to our conversations in really productive ways. For English majors, this course satisfies your American Literature and Identity/Difference requirements. In the past, the course has counted toward the “Sustainability” track in Engineering.  Requirements: reading and viewing all assigned texts/films, two 4-5pp papers, a terms and identification test, and, at the end of the term, a slightly longer final paper (6-8pp) or creative project (virtual exhibit design or memorial object, short story, play).Class Format:Learning Mode: All class meetings will be taught synchronously and In-Person for the Fall 2021 term.

The American Novel,"“One thing about the ghetto, you don’t have to hurry / It’ll be there tomorrow, so, brother, don’t you worry!” The haunting lyrics of Rick James’s classic funk song “Ghetto Life” capture the ambivalence that many of us feel toward a certain kind of urban space. Why do so many stories in American popular culture, from West Side Story to The Wire, seem to revolve around life in ghetto communities? What draws us to tales about the exploits of the so-called underclass in such places? Do we, as the rapper Nas says, “love to hear the stories [about] how the thugs live in worry” out of voyeurism, pity, contempt, hope for social justice, or perhaps some combination of all these things?","Mitchell,Justin David",ENGLISH,362,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The American Ghetto Novel,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Jane Austen,"This course offers you the opportunity to spend a semester studying the works of Jane Austen. We’ll read all six of Austen’s completed novels, selections from her juvenilia and unfinished works, and key pieces of Austen scholarship. We’ll also read selections of works by some of her predecessors and contemporaries—such as Edmund Burke, Fanny Burney, Thomas Clarkson, William Gilpin, Ann Radcliffe, Adam Smith, and Mary Wollstonecraft—in order to understand the literary, intellectual, and historical conditions that enabled Austen to become one of the most important authors in the development of the novel. As we study Austen’s formal innovations and rhetorical techniques (such as free indirect speech and irony), we’ll pay particular attention to how she responds to and registers the social and political issues and events of her time (such as gender inequities and primogeniture, abolitionism and the slave trade, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars). Since Austen continues to speak to new generations of readers, we’ll also examine a few film adaptations of her novels and consider what her writing might have to say about the issues and events that define our own contemporary moment.","Schey,Taylor",ENGLISH,370,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Studies in Native American Literature,"An expression coined in 1983 by critic Kenneth Lincoln, “Native American Renaissance” refers to an American Indian literary movement that came into existence following N. Scott Momaday’s receipt of the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for his novel House Made of Dawn. Momaday was not our first successful Native American writer – Indians had been publishing in the English language fairly continuously for the previous two centuries – but he was the first to receive a major American literary award. Since literary movements and awards do not happen in a historical vacuum, we should observe that the Native American Renaissance was happening at the same time as the “Red Power” Indian civil rights movement: a highly visible, sometimes notorious, and generally militant series of occupations of public spaces by young Indian activists. Although the two movements were rather different in both form and content, this class will read the Native American Renaissance literary movement in – and just as often against – the Red Power movement. Most of the literary texts we will study are modernist novels from the nineteen-sixties and seventies; they are aesthetically ambitious, artistically brilliant, and sometimes challenging. In addition to Momaday, our authors will include Leslie Marmon Silko, James Welch, and Gerald Vizenor.","Lyons,Scott Richard",ENGLISH,382,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Literature in African History,"This course is about the history of African literature. The reading list includes some of the founding works in the field. It also includes lesser-known texts: novels published serially in West African newspapers; editorial writings from early Christian converts; a play from a beleaguered Ugandan author. We’ll be studying how African writers, in their creative work, participated in the political and moral arguments of their time. Literature was not an escape from real life. African writers did work in their texts: they conjured up audiences, fired them with a shared vision of the past and the future, and set them on a forward path together. By studying the social and political work that African writers did, this course explores the intersection of literature and history, and of imagination and politics. The course is organized around three national literatures: the literatures of Nigeria, of Kenya, and of South Africa. In each of the case studies we’ll be tracing the historical development of a particular literary tradition, studying how authors commented on the changing politics of their homelands. We’ll also be exploring a set of cross-cutting themes that draw the three case studies together. Some of these texts define and defend a national community. Other texts depict the crisis of urban life in twentieth century Africa. In the whole of our work together we’ll be asking a set of questions about the vocation of the literary writer. What were these authors doing in their own time? What was literature good for?","Peterson,Derek R",ENGLISH,389,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Junior Seminar in English Studies,"This course introduces upper-level undergraduate students to graphic novels and comics from and about the Muslim world: from the Arab and Persian Middle East, to South and Southeast Asia, North Africa, and immigrant communities in Europe and the United States. The common theme of the works we examine is the struggle to reconcile Islamic religious and Muslim cultural values with each other, and with imperialism, neocolonialism, democracy, and technology, in the contemporary world context of civil unrest and mass voluntary and refugee migrations.","Khan,Aliyah R",ENGLISH,398,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Islam in Graphic Novels,4,ULWR,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

We will read a survey of cultural reportage—primarily personal essays, reviews, and opinion pieces—for textual, cultural, and aesthetic analysis to think about the ways that race, gender, and sexuality intersect and operate thematically and politically in that writing. Our study of this writing will impact the main focus of this class: It is a writing workshop, in which each student will present her or his work for critique. Writing assignments will be expected of each student and possibly lead to the production of a class-produced blog or magazine at the end of the semester.","Poulson-Bryant,Scott",ENGLISH,398,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003," - Flawless/Formation/Freedom: Writing about Race, Gender, and Popular Culture",4,"HU, ULWR",,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Topics in Language and Rhetorical Studies,"What is the purpose of education? What should we learn, and why? Our current debates about curriculum and assessment focus on one outcome of education – to prepare students for participation in civil society and the market. However, our lives as citizens are only one facet of how the classical tradition viewed the life of the mind. As Aristotle said in The Politics, “To be always seeking after the useful does not become free and exalted souls.” This class explores how the classical tradition understood education – as essential training not only for public life and civic engagement, but also for the development and elevation of the body and soul.","Nichols,Dana",ENGLISH,403,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Life of the Mind: Classical Rhetoric and Education,3,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Topics in English Language and Literature,"This course introduces students to key texts and debates at the intersection of global works of literature and international human rights. Increased recognition of universal rights for all human beings is broadly understood to be one of the most important moral and political developments of the last century. In turn, many scholars have contended that a belief in human rights is grounded in the reading and writing of literature. To test these claims, students in this class work with literary texts as a means of investigating the historical origins, present challenges, and potential future of human rights as a framework for global justice and human flourishing.","Bakara,Hadji",ENGLISH,407,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Literature and Human Rights,3,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Old English,"This course is an introduction to Old English, the language spoken by our forebears until the unpleasantness at Hastings — the Norman Conquest.  Since Old English is so different from Modern English as to seem like another language, the greatest effort of this class will be to master the rudiments of the structure and vocabulary of the earliest attested form of English.  The reward is being able to read an excitingly different corpus of prose and poetry.  You will also develop a new appreciation of where our language, culture, and intellectual traditions come from.  Course requirements:  daily recitation, weekly quizzes, two-hour exams, a term project (written and oral presentation).

You will deepen your close reading skills, and you will make your own short videos using your phones.

We will read work from writers like Jemele Hill, Wright Thompson, Howard Bryant, Jackie MacMullan, and others.  As we do, we will examine the role of ""story"" in writing on sports through profiles, narratives, and research essays.  We'll also discuss how writers frame and shape narratives, how writers use evidence and outside voices, and how you can continue to develop your own writing voice and style.

Directed Writing,"As a privilege for students who have displayed academic excellence and who can show appropriate preparation in courses previously taken, the Department of English offers course credit for independent study. Independent study provides an opportunity for highly motivated and capable students to pursue a rigorous course of study that is not accommodated elsewhere in the curriculum.

Independent study proposals require advance planning. Each must be developed in consultation with a full-time member of the English Department faculty who will serve as a faculty mentor for the project, and subsequently must be approved by the Undergraduate Chair of the Department. Interested students should begin consulting with their mentors during the semester before the proposed independent study in order to develop a feasible course. Only those proposing a carefully structured and intellectually viable course of study that is not already offered in the undergraduate curriculum should submit applications. Independent study requires that students design their own courses, create their own syllabi, and work closely with faculty mentors. Supervising professors must donate a great deal of time and effort, so students applying for independent study should be similarly committed to the project. Students must be in residence in order to undertake independent study projects. A three-credit independent study should involve at least one hour of student-faculty contact plus an additional eight hours of work per week. It is also possible to elect two or four credit hours with appropriate changes in workload.

Professors normally do not supervise independent studies during terms when they are on leave, nor do they supervise them on subjects which fall outside of their areas of specialization, or on subjects covered by regular course offerings. A limit of six credit hours of independent study may be accumulated in the English department. Independent study projects cannot be used to fulfill Department program requirements or College distribution requirements.
Please keep in mind, if you are planning on doing your independent study in writing (ENGLISH 426) and have already taken and applied a writing course to your English concentration, the credit will not count toward your 27 credits. You are allowed to use only one creative or expository writing course toward the concentration whether it is independent study or a regular ENGLISH course (ENGLISH 301, 323, 325, 423, 425, etc.)
To apply:

Pick up an Independent Study Application at the English Department office at 3187 Angell Hall. 
Complete Part I of the independent study application and attach a statement addressing each of the questions posed there along with a copy of your transcript.
Part II of the application must be completed by the supervising faculty member. 
Submit both parts of this proposal to the Undergraduate Secretary in 3187 Angell Hall.

Modern Poetry,"The course surveys the major poetic voices of the first half of the 20th Century to the extent possible within one term. We shall begin by considering the emergence of Modernism and early practitioners such as W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and Marianne Moore as well as some outspoken dissenters from the movement like William Carlos Williams. The poetry of the Harlem Renaissance was certainly energized by some of the aesthetic priorities of Modernism even as it resisted others, as we shall see in the work of Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes. The unprecedented hardship wrought by the Great Depression had a profound impact on the poetry of the 1930s, whether for well-established voices like Robert Frost or relative newcomers like W. H. Auden. Finally, in addition to the theme of poverty and economic inequality, we shall also explore the challenges and opportunities posed by the rise of the entertainment industry and mass culture more generally.","Larson,Kerry C",ENGLISH,440,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Modern Poetry:  1900-1950,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Studies in the Novel,"Novels are fictional—that is, explicitly made-up stories about imaginary characters—yet they typically strive to convince their readers they are true to life. Taking this paradox as our starting point, this course will explore such questions as: What techniques do novelists use to make their novels seem “realistic”—and what does that even mean? What understanding of reality do novels promote? How have these techniques and these understandings changed over time? What assumptions—about people or society or the universe—guide our own sense of how true-to-life a novel seems?

Studies in Individual Authors,"This is a course for students who desire to be part of an intensely focused group of readers that will work its way through what has repeatedly been called the greatest novel of the past century: James Joyce’s Ulysses. As I trust we will all discover, Ulysses is a book that is best read in such a group. It is extremely difficult but also very much worth the effort that it demands of its readers. And though Ulysses will constitute the central object of our study, this course will challenge and reward you with an exploration of a great deal of Joyce's prose, including Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and selected poetry and essays as well. At the end of the term, we will make a brief excursion into Finnegans Wake.

Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales,"“What prevents me from telling the truth with a smile?”  Chaucer was the first great satirist in English; his poetry was humorous, experimental, even avant-garde—and devoted to telling the truth through made-up stories.  This course will focus on the Canterbury Tales, a diverse anthology of stories varying in style, genre, and fictional teller. Written during a time of extraordinary social and political upheaval at the end of the fourteenth century, this framed story collection includes both the stately Knight's Tale and the ribald Miller's Tale, stories about women both obedient and disorderly, clerics both corrupt and . . . well,  more corrupt.  Along the way, it creates a new audience in English for literature simultaneously playful and serious. We will read most of the Tales, paying attention to the work's qualities as an innovative story collection. Central questions will include: How does the Canterbury Tales address—or even create—its audience? What does its interpretative openness accomplish? What relations develop between literary style and social position? How does the language of the text create the imaginative impression of complex characters?  How does one story speak to another?  We will focus especially on narrative voices and the effects they create in their readers; audiotapes will help us hear these voices in Middle English.","Taylor,Karla T",ENGLISH,465,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Honors Colloquium:  Drafting the Thesis,"The goal of this course is to support you in conceiving and writing an honors thesis.  A thesis is a multi-part analytical project, which requires different skills from those needed to write a shorter essay on a prescribed topic; we, therefore, explore the research and writing methods such a project requires, such as creating a project bibliography, reading scholarship critically in order to join a scholarly “conversation,” identifying what makes good research questions, drafting discrete sections with an eye to revision, bringing multiple pieces of writing together into a larger whole, and understanding the purposes of individual sections, such as abstracts, introductions, and conclusions.

Old English,"This course is an introduction to Old English, the language spoken by our forebears until the unpleasantness at Hastings — the Norman Conquest.  Since Old English is so different from Modern English as to seem like another language, the greatest effort of this class will be to master the rudiments of the structure and vocabulary of the earliest attested form of English.  The reward is being able to read an excitingly different corpus of prose and poetry.  You will also develop a new appreciation of where our language, culture, and intellectual traditions come from.  Course requirements:  daily recitation, weekly quizzes, two-hour exams, a term project (written and oral presentation).  Written work also includes regular short modernizations and longer take-home modernizations.","Toon,Thomas E",ENGLISH,501,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Introduction to Global Change:  The Science Behind Sustainability," Everyday, human and natural activities are altering the planet on which we live. Through our increasing resource consumption, population growth, disturbance of natural systems, and technological advancement, we are changing the global climate and environment in a manner that is unique over Earth’s history. Many of these changes are degrading the physical and biological processes that underpin Earth’s life-support systems, which poses a great challenge for society in this century.
 This course, Global Change — the Science of Sustainability, investigates the causes and impacts of these changes using a combination of traditional lecture-based and modern digital teaching methodologies. The course surveys the evolution and interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes on Earth; how past changes on Earth help us predict the future, especially with respect to climate change; and how fundamental principles of science establish the sustainability of human activities on Earth. Students apply learned knowledge by using ‘systems modeling’ and spreadsheet software to investigate the dynamics of natural systems and examine case studies of relevant environmental problems.
  The course curriculum provides excellent opportunities to conduct research on topics of interest to the students, culminating in a course project presented at the end of the academic term. The interactive laboratory exercises provide students the opportunity to use software tools to examine how natural systems function as well as develop projections of the future consequences of changes in the environment. And, perhaps most important of all, students will have ample time for discussion of critical issues in natural resources and sustainability, and the role of environmental science in policy and society as a whole. All topics are developed in a manner that students will find both accessible and interesting. After the course, students should be able to discern sound science from biased claims and will have a foundation for making informed decisions about sustainable practices in their own lives.

First-Year Seminar in the Environment,"Food is central to our lives, culture, and wellbeing. From the early days of the Republic, food production has been an economic engine for the US, shaping our social and political processes. Food is also a cultural touchstone: a first foray into the dining hall with a sea of unfamiliar faces, a first date over dinner, a late-night trek to Insomnia Cookies. American food has evolved from the meat and potatoes of the 1950’s to today’s Farm to Table movement. Each iteration illustrates bits of our nation’s historical moments, like the Victory Gardens during World War I and II.


American farmers, chefs, social justice advocates, and writers have chronicled these evolutions in both word and deed. At UM we are leading efforts to ameliorate food deserts in Detroit, working for food justice, and educating ourselves through hands-on experiential learning at the Campus Farm. This course will explore the writers of the modern food movement. We’ll visit local food producers, farmer’s markets, and host writers and farmers in our classroom.

Topics in Environmental Social Science,"Blood diamonds. Resource curse. Land grabs. The tragedy of the commons. These concepts are often used to frame discussions about natural resource politics and environmental management in Africa. Time and again, we hear that corruption (in government) and overexploitation (by poor citizens) are preventing sustainable development, putting biodiversity conservation at risk, and providing fodder for ongoing conflict. This course prompts students to critically engage with these narratives through an appraisal of popular media, policy documents, and relevant scholarship in the fields of political economy, geography, anthropology, political ecology, and development studies. In doing so, we aim to uncover substantiations, deviations, and contradictions in cases across the African continent. Students will leave the course better equipped to interrogate the ways in which environmental and development challenges are shaped and landscapes produced by the complex interplay of local, national, and global forces.","Klein,Brian",ENVIRON,152,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Reconsider Afr Environments,3,SS,FYSem,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).  ,

Sustainability and Society,"In this course, students will be introduced to the concepts of sustainability, starting with definitions, interpretations, and practices pursued by different groups to achieve sustainability. Particular attention will be paid to the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to develop more effective approaches to the complex issues of sustainability we face now and in the future from the perspective of the present and future stewardship of global systems. Students will learn how science can be integrated with policy and the humanities to achieve important sustainability goals, including reduced carbon emissions, diverse and robust ecosystems, reduced consumption and waste production, improved quality of life, and sustainable cities. Through a concentrated study of this emerging sphere we call sustainability, students will learn to articulate the relationships among observed phenomena, the principles and policies those observations can inform, particularly how best to integrate technology, education, and policy to best meet identified goals. By doing so, students will learn how to place individual and collective behavior in a context that better allows for consumption patterns that best promote sustainability.","Newell, Josh  ",ENVIRON,207,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,Sustain,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Introduction to Environmental Science Laboratory,"Lab sections will provide opportunities to dig deeper into specific topics of environmental science. The labs will focus on two types course material of importance in environmental science. 
The first type of material is related to the highly controversial nature of many topics that are covered in lectures. Many students are passionate about many topics from population control to environmental standards to renewable energy to GMOs. Whereas some students are satisfied learning about controversial topics in lecture, others crave the opportunity to research and debate these topics in a small group setting. 
The second type of material utilized in the labs relate to quantitative data sets, calculations and models. Some students are skeptical about conclusions reported by the media related to environmental issues and want to work with ""real"" datasets themselves. These quantitative labs require extensive interaction with fellow students and GSIs. Data from the peer-reviewed literature and government agency websites must be located and evaluated.

Environment and History in Preindustrial Europe,"How did pre-industrial societies fit into the various ecological systems of western Eurasia? How different were the adaptations of people in Scandinavia, Normandy, or Andalusia to the climate, landscape, other animals, and vegetation of their regions? What ecological forces made some communities collapse and others thrive? Did nature determine what humans could do, and what they actually did? What impact did pre-industrial human activity have on the European environment? These are some of the main questions Hist. 236 asks. The course focuses on the ancient, medieval, and early modern periods (roughly 300 BC to AD 1800), and ranges widely across the vast and diverse landmass of “Europe” (with some detours into the relevant sea masses, too). While offering a long view of environmental change, it shows that before the Industrial Revolution, just as in later industrialized societies, European people were entangled in nature and that their history was shaped by ecological relationships. As contemporary societies uncertainly navigate environmental change, it becomes more important to understand how past societies coped with their own mutable environments. Hist./ Environ. 236 advances that understanding. Hist./ Environ. 236 meets twice per week, mixing discussion with lectures. A mid-term test, a take-home final exam, and two 5-page essays are required. Assigned readings are available on Canvas.","Squatriti,Paolo",ENVIRON,236,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Environmental Social Science,"The course aims to actively engage students in environmental policy research, broadly defined to include not just conventional issues such as air and water pollution, but also--and especially--ever-evolving energy and climate policy.  In this hands-on course, students will gain a deeper understanding of contemporary environmental policy research, as well as develop personal expertise with a specific aspect of this policy arena.  They will also acquire research skills applicable to both public policy and the social sciences, and hone their written and verbal communication abilities. 


The course begins by introducing students to policy research techniques, with readings and class discussion largely drawing from the specific environmental policy interests of the students in the class. Students will then spend the remainder of the term researching a topic of their choosing on energy or environmental policy. These may include the student's own environmental policy passion, or a topic that complements the instructor's ongoing research in the Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy (CLOSUP) Energy and Environmental Policy Initiative, including the National Surveys on Energy and the Environment. Suitable research projects may address some aspect of the allocation of regulatory authority between national, state, and local government; the inclusion or omission of particular policy levers within the overall regulatory framework; or constituencies of support or opposition for a particular policy option.","Princen,Thomas E",ENVIRON,302,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Extreme Events,3,SS,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).  ,With permission of instructor.
Topics in Environmental Social Science,"This course examines extreme events—e.g., fires, floods, heatwaves, cold snaps—for their social
effects. It looks for both short-term responses (emergency response, immediate impacts, recovery, and
rebuild) and long-term response (changes in living patterns, in relation to natural systems, in consumption and mobility) and how those responses vary with cultural setting, socioeconomic position, inequality, and power. 

Throughout, the course will look for opportunities to use extreme events to create a more sustainable and just society. For this it will examine historical cases—e.g., 1789 Lisbon earthquake and fires, 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fires, the 1889 Johnstown flood, and the Peshtigo Wisconsin fire—and contemporary cases—e.g., 2002 heatwave in Europe, the 2017 Santa Rosa fire, and the 2018 rain bomb in Houston. From there, the course will look to the future to imagine positive responses to expected but unpredictable extreme events.

The course thus approaches extreme events from a multitude of perspectives, including those of climate, history, sociology, engineering, political science, planning, and even some literature and art.Class Format:The course is structured primarily as a lecture but has features of a seminar (daily readings and discussion). Students must prepare daily, engage in discussions (including written submissions), and collaborate with each other for research, public presentation, and discussion.

Topics in Culture and Environment,"This course investigates the roles that animals have historically played in children’s literature, illustration, and film. Why do stories for the young frequently employ animal life to explore human suffering? How do images and ideas about the child and the beast conflate in our myths? As boys and girls grow up distanced from farm and wildlife, how do other species animate what it means to be child and adult? This Upper-Level Writing Requirement course studies the aesthetic, generic, and rhetorical uses of animals in visual and verbal media. It pairs theoretical perspectives with traditions of animal figuration--from ancient fables and the 18th century models for English-speaking children to contemporary children’s literature and films.","Goodenough,Elizabeth N",ENVIRON,304,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Rite's of Reading: The Animal Story,3,"ULWR, HU",Sustain,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).  ,
Topics in Culture and Environment,"In “Prayer for the Mutilated World,” Sam Sax wonders “what will be left after we’ve left,” and offers a tender and weary answer to his own question: “i dare not consider it // instead dance with me a moment / late in this last extinction // that you are reading this / must be enough.” How are contemporary writers imagining the world and the role of literature in the midst of the change, destruction, and dislocation associated with what has been termed the sixth mass extinction event? How do they define “environment,” their relation to it, and their place within it? From climate fiction (“cli-fi”) to necropastoral poems and beyond, we will read literary works, as well as academic scholarship and popular writing, that respond to these questions.","Chakraborty,Sumita",ENVIRON,304,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Writing in a Time of Extinct,3,HU,Sustain,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).  ,
Topics in Culture and Environment,"

Nature and the environment feature prominently in the philosophy and cultural traditions of the German-speaking world—from the deification of nature within Romantic poetry and painting, through the blood-and-soil ideology of the Nazis, to the land art of Joseph Beuys and Hans Haacke during the Cold War. Today, German, Austrian, and Swiss people are considered some of the world’s most environmentally conscious, a fact reflected in the extent to which environmental issues currently shape the political agendas of their respective countries.

While it may sound like it should belong exclusively to political or scientific activity, ecocriticism is environmentally focused criticism practiced by producers of literature, film, art, and theory. American films like the Mad Max Trilogy, The Day After Tomorrow, or Pixar’s WALL-E are popular earlier examples of the post-apocalyptic genre that has exploded in the last five years, and which arguably participates in ecocriticism by imagining the worlds that might exist after environmental collapse; novels like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road or Emily St. John Mandel’s Station 11 are examples of a similar strain of criticism in English-language literature.

In this course we will examine ecocriticism’s history and the appearance and disappearance of environmental themes in German-language literature, film, and art over the course of the last two centuries. We will read and learn about: the Anthropocene and Industrial Revolution, Alexander von Humboldt, J. W. Goethe, and Goethean science, Novalis, German Romanticism and the philosophy of nature, Adalbert Stifter, Ernst Haeckel and the reception of Darwinism in Germany, Wilhelm Riehl, Franz Kafka, the Blue Rider group, Martin Heidegger, the Frankfurt School, Ingeborg Bachmann, Joseph Beuys, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Elfriede Jelinek, Herta Müller, Sharon Dodua Otoo, Carl Amery and Germany’s Green Party, Yoko Tawada, Werner Herzog, Dorothee Elmiger and the European migration crisis, ecothriller film and more.

Interdisciplinary Environmental Topics,"The Great Lakes region includes the 5 Great Lakes, parts of eight US States, and Canada.  It is an economically important region, with seven major cities, and is home to over 30 million people.  It has extreme variability in land use and human impacts, from pristine, wildland ecosystems in the north to completely human-dominated landscapes of industrial agriculture in the south, with fragmented forests and rural landscapes in between.  This course will address six to eight sustainability issues or ‘wicked’ environmental problems in the region.  Wicked issues are those that cross disciplines, cross cultures, cross ecosystems, and scales, and that have multiple types of stakeholders that often do not agree on the definition of the problem.  The course will use a case study approach.  Rather than learning general principles about a single discipline, students will undertake an in-depth analysis of each issue, building multiple layers of understanding that draw from a range of disciplines and perspectives.  Specific case studies are still being developed, but are likely to include issues like the following:  harmful algal blooms and dead zones in Lake Erie; forest management, forest jobs, forest fragmentation, and habitat loss; wetland loss, invasive species, management, and restoration; sediments, harbor dredging, shipping, and coastal stressors; urban sprawl into exurban and rural landscapes; water quality, water withdrawals, and industrial water use.

Global Water,"Water, like religion and ideology, has the power to move millions of people. . . . People move when there is too little of it. People move when there is too much of it. . .  People fight over it.  And all people, everywhere and every day, need it.  
 -- Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, president of Green Cross International

Water is both a local and a global resource:  it is fundamental at the most basic, individual level and it is intertwined with national, regional, and international affairs.  Today, nearly one billion people — roughly one out of seven people on the planet — are “water deprived,” meaning they do not have enough freshwater to ensure their basic sanitation, irrigation, or drinking needs. With the world’s population expected to grow by 2.5 billion people by 2050 (mostly in areas of the world that are already water deprived), freshwater will be a critical challenge of the 21st century. 
Overpopulation, urbanization, pollution, food security, energy, corruption, technology, human rights, governance, and climate change, just to name a few issues, are all intimately connected to water availability. This course will link these and other issues with three main themes: 
•	balancing competing demands for freshwater, 
•	ensuring human and environmental health, and
•	cooperating across borders.
Several case studies from around the globe, illustrating the use and abuse of water, will be considered. 


Upon completion of this course, students will better understand:  water challenges and opportunities throughout the globe, how governments and non-government organizations function in water management, and the differences and similarities of water issues between developing and developed nations.  Students will also have honed their writing skills, skills essential to successful employment and graduate work in the field.Course Requirements:Students will be expected to read critically, reflect on lectures and readings, engage actively in discussion, and display solid writing skills.
 
Course requirements:    Active participation; two papers; take-home final exam; and other small assignments related to current events.Intended Audience:This course assumes a basic foundation in environmental policy and international affairs, usually provided in 100- and 200-level PITE and political science courses.  Students who are interested in reading, active participation, and improving their writing skills are invited to enroll in this course.Class Format:Course Format and Skills Gained:  This course will consist of readings, lectures, discussions, and writing assignments in the form of papers and short essays (there will be no midterm or final exams).

Sustainability and Health,"We live in a unique time. Cheap energy and technological innovation have transformed the way we live. We can travel vast distances in a few hours. Products of every shape and size fill our homes. Every food imaginable can be bought at any time we wish. While these advances have certainly enriched our lives in many ways they have also come at a cost. The consumption-based lifestyle that we have embraced is not only altering the climate and degrading ecosystems, but it is increasing jeopardizing human health. Encouraging people to adopt more environmentally sustainable lifestyles, however, has proven to be challenging. If people believe this coming transition will involve sacrifice and a more difficult way of life they will be unlikely to get involved. Fortunately, an alternative perspective is possible. What if we could create an environmentally sustainable future that is better equipped to support human health and well-being than our current lifestyle? Would people be more willing to participate and try out new ways of doing things? The purpose of this course is to explore this idea by considering how the environment influences our health and well-being. In order to tackle this complex topic, we will begin by identifying the physical, psychological, and social dimensions of human health. We then explore how climate change could negatively impact human health and consider the ways in which our modern lifestyle makes it difficult for us to achieve and maintain good health. Finally, we will think about how the shift to a more sustainable lifestyle could positively impact our health and well-being. 
Topics will likely include: 

 The connections between environmental health and human health 
 How to assess health and well-being 
 The impact our current lifestyle has on a broad range of health outcomes 
 Diseases of affluence and their consequences, such as obesity 
 Health impacts of climate change 
 Comparing various countries/societies in terms of health and sustainability outcomes 
 The connection between health, social capital, and community capacity 
 Green Care and the benefits of spending time in nature 
 Health impacts associated with simplicity and localization 
Course Requirements:Multiple project-based writing assignments will be used to evaluate student performance. The first involves adopting several conservation behaviors for a limited period of time and tracking how these behaviors impact well-being and quality of life. Students will then be asked to write a paper about this experience (20%). Students in the course will also work in 2-3 person teams to selecting a topic related to sustainability and write an in-depth research report exploring how the selected issue relates to physiological, psychological, and social aspects of human health (40%). Each student will then use this report as a basis for a shorter “magazine-style” popular press article (20%). Active participation in the course and will be expected and will account for 20% of the student's final grade. Students will be asked to contribute to class discussions, ask questions about course readings/topics, and participate in-class activities.Intended Audience:Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors.Class Format:Learning Mode: All class meetings will be taught synchronously and In-Person for the Fall 2021 term.

Conservation of Biological Diversity,"The course focuses on one of the major problems that humanity is facing today: the irrevocable loss of global biological diversity. In the first part of the course, students are provided with an overview of diversification and extinction in the geologic record, and then explore the patterns, magnitude, and causes of the currently mounting mega-extinction spasm. In the second part, the course focuses on approaches that can be used to recover endangered species, address habitat conservation problems, and achieve ecological sustainability. 
  Students achieve expertise on the course topics through engagement in a combination of lectures, weekly discussions, assigned readings, films, field trips, and computer exercises. At the end of the class, students will be equipped to understand and address problems relating to declining populations and the sustainable management of biological resources. Class Format:Weekly discussions deal with material from lectures, assigned readings, and films; and performing computer and gaming simulations.

"Environmental Journalism:  Reporting About Science, Policy, and Public Health","This course aims to give students an introduction to the world of mass media, with a strong emphasis on reporting and writing about the environment and public health. This class has consistently won high praise from students for providing personalized, hands-on training in improving writing skills. Students learn from two prize-winning journalists who have more than 40 years combined experience covering the environment and public health for media outlets such as The New York Times, Newsweek, The Detroit Free Press, and National Public Radio. Each week, the course focuses on a different topic in the news related to the environment or public health, which may include alternative energy, the environmental future of the auto industry, energy efficiency, climate change, environmental justice, garbage, pandemics, or cancer. 

Students hear from a range of leading experts on the topic of the day, learning not only about the subject itself but also about the process of journalism. Guest speakers are chosen to represent many points of view. They range from corporate executives to environmental activists, scientists, government officials, and journalists. Past speakers have included former SNRE Dean Rosina Bierbaum; Donele Wilkins, Executive Director of Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice; State Senator Liz Brater; Zoe Lipman of The National Wildlife Federation; Mike Johnston of the Michigan Manufacturers’ Association; Joe White, The Wall Street Journal’s Detroit Bureau chief; Lester Graham of The Environment Report, a public radio show; and 60 Minutes producer Alden Bourne, among many others. Along the way, instructors lecture and steer discussions about media ethics, interviewing skills, freedom-of-information laws, the Internet as a source of information, government databases, and many other journalism-related topics. Course Requirements:
 Active participation in class discussions

Climate Change and Adaptation,"Climate change is no longer a distant and abstract threat but a present and lived reality. Unaddressed, it will continue to wreak havoc on the systems necessary for human survival, with the greatest burdens most often falling on already vulnerable populations. While there is reason to hope that the worst possible impacts of climate change can still be avoided by transforming our global energy system, societies must also begin to prepare for changes that are already underway. Preparing for climate change requires understanding the complexities of an increasingly volatile planet, implementing steps that can reduce harm or increase benefits, and learning from those efforts to continuously improve. All this must be done in the context of political and economic systems that are ill-equipped to facilitate the kind of equitable, swift, long-term efforts that an effective response to climate change demands. 


This course will apply the lens of social science to provide students a thorough grounding in the field of climate change adaptation. In examining the social dimensions of climate change, the course will introduce students to the key concepts and areas of knowledge related to climate impacts, vulnerability and resilience, historical human adaptations to climate variability, changes, and impacts, and future adaptation needs. In particular, the course will identify the major areas in which coordinated efforts by governments, civil society organizations, researchers, and market actors can successfully prepare for different scenarios of climate change impacts. In addition to providing a strong knowledge base on climate change adaptation, the course will include a series of guest speakers and practice-relevant assignments aimed at helping students prepare to be adaptive and effective leaders wherever their future career paths may take them. 


After an introductory week of class, instruction in the course will focus on five major questions: 


1. What is climate change? 

2. How will climate change affect life as we know it on Earth? 

3. How have societies adapted to change in the past; and what will adaptation look like moving into the future? 

4. What are the policy and governance options available to undertake adaptation? 

5. What can be done as individuals to help the communities and organizations we operate in to become more adaptive?Intended Audience:This course can be taken by any undergraduate student interested in the effects of and responses to climate change.Class Format:3 hr/week lecture format. The final three weeks of classes will entail short group presentations based on student research on pre-assigned topics.

Environmental Geochemistry,"In Environmental Geochemistry, our broad goals will be to understand geochemical processes occurring on Earth’s surface and the impacts of human activities on diverse environments. Students will learn fundamental principles including 1) how to predict and interpret chemical speciation in water during acid/base reactions and redox reactions, and 2) how the hydrosphere interacts with rocks, sediments, soils, and the atmosphere. Students will also learn the field, laboratory, and analytical techniques used in environmental geochemistry research and application. We will master these skills through problem-focused modules focusing on air pollution, carbon dioxide and the ocean, arsenic in the bengal basin, and acid mine drainage. This course is designed for students who want to know more about environmental processes occurring around them and/or are interested in a career in environmental or geotechnical fields in industry, applied sciences, or academia.","Robbins,Mark James",ENVIRON,325,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Climate and Climate Change,"Humans play a large role in determining the climate on planet Earth, altering the composition of the atmosphere and changing the biological productivity of the land across continental scales. The impacts of these changes are becoming more obvious every year, exacting costs in human lives, livelihoods, health, and economies, and impacting the natural ecosystems that support the Earth’s biodiversity. In this class, students learn how the Earth’s climate works as a system, both naturally and in response to human perturbations. We draw on examples from modern climate change, natural climate variability, and a range of different climates from the Earth’s geologic past to better understand the Earth’s climate system and the physical, biogeochemical, and ecological processes that maintain it. We examine evidence of ongoing climate change and explore the disparate impacts of climate change on local, regional, and global communities, including strategies for adaptation and mitigation.

"Introduction to Environment Politics:  Race, Class, and Gender","This course introduces students to global environmental politics, justice and development. This course will explore environmental issues around the world and the relatedness of nature to politics, development and culture. We will address historically unique social form that presents special challenges to our understanding of environmental politics, gender, race and culture by looking at case studies from around the world. Among the questions that we will examine are the following: How have local and global histories, memories, practices, values, gender, race and identities that derive from our understanding of politics intersect with nature? Are there environmental issues that are also issues of race, class and gender?  For example, are there particular forms of knowledge and subjectivity that intersect or interact with race and gender difference, or ideas about civilization and primitivity that could be seen as distinctive instruments of environmental rule?","Adunbi,Omolade",ENVIRON,335,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Introduction to Environmental Politics: Race, Class and Gender",4,"ULWR, SS, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Southern Natures: The Making and Unmaking of Races and Environments in the US South,"In this course, we will explore southern US environmental, racial, and cultural history. We will think about how southern environments have been created, experienced, and turned into narrative and visual art since the colonial period, with an emphasis on the 1840-present period. We’ll think about how notions of racial difference, gradually codified in southern colonies and states beginning around 1700, came to be “naturalized” (with reference to environmental factors like climate), while it was a majority Africa-descended workforce who was carrying out the work of environmental alterations (deforestation, staple cultivation, infrastructure building, etc.). We’ll think both about unequal exposures to environmental harm (a fundamental concern in the Environmental Justice movement), but also about deep traditions of environmental love and affinity across southern communities.


We’ll start with a long unit on Hurricane Katrina, as remembered through the work of filmmakers, mapmakers, visual artists and journalists. Next we’ll look at contemporary plantation (and Civil War) memorialization to consider how the plantation lives on in our built and cultural environments. These first weeks spent looking at the contemporary scene will set up some mysteries for us to solve in the rest of the term: how were these contemporary legacies of the plantation era produced historically? We’ll jump back to Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the States of Virginia (1782) and work our way forward again, through authors and artists like Frederick Douglass, Solomon Northup, Charles Chesnutt, William Faulkner, Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright.


I very much welcome students from across the university to take this class. In past years, students in Engineering, PitE, English, Art & Design and other majors/schools have brought their academic fluencies to our conversations in really productive ways.

Behavior and Environment,"This course deals with two central themes: 


  First, environmental problems are people's problems.  To promote environmental stewardship we must understand how we think, what we care about, what motivates us, and the conditions under which we behave more reasonably. 

Second, our behavior closely interacts with the environments we find ourselves in.   To understand why we act as we do, it is useful to understand the demands environments place upon, and the opportunities they afford human cognition.  


The course explores a model of human nature which includes:



      How people come to know and understand environments
	Which types of environments humans prefer
	How humans cope with non-preferred environments
	The role that mental fatigue and restoration have in everyday functioning


The course:


	Presents evidence of the strong connection between human health/well-being and the environment
	Discusses what human information processing has to say about:
  Design (e.g., architecture, landscapes, planning, urban 
             settings,institutions)
  Effective communication (e.g., teaching in general, communicating 
             about the environment)
  Program implementation (e.g., behavior change in general, 
             promoting environmentally sustainable lifestyles)
	Explores strategies for better managing our time and choosing settings 
        in which we function more effectively


Students taking the course often have no previous experience in the psychology of human-environment interaction.  The course is useful to any field of study dealing with human behavior (e.g., environmental studies; education and communication; health education and behavior; conservation psychology; resource policy, planning, and management; organizational and institutional studies;  landscape architecture and urban planning; green and sustainable business)

Urban Sprawl:  Policy and Politics,"This course investigates the political imperatives and policy frameworks at the local, state, and national levels that drive land development in America. It leverages political science, history, law, and urban planning to understand how public policy does (and does not) guide land use patterns, and how it might do so differently in the future. The course uses the phenomenon of urban sprawl as a lens through which to integrate multiple disciplinary perspectives in a rich and nuanced understanding of policy change. Students are required to exercise, in written and oral work, their faculties of analysis and (especially) synthesis, unpacking a complex policy challenge into discrete elements and then analyzing the interplay among these elements. The course is first and foremost a capstone experience in critical thinking, using a policy arena with which the students are familiar as a platform for that experience. The course is organized as a seminar. While it does teach a certain policy vocabulary and test students’ critical thinking and writing skills, it ultimately demands much more. It requires students to actively interrogate and synthesize the course material in order to generate a new, shared understanding. Students’ formal (written) and informal (in-class) commentary on the readings are central to the organization of each class session (along with brief lectures and small-group exercises). Their research projects culminate in memos that are required reading for the final weeks of the class. In short, the course expects students to exercise the skills that professional policy work and/or graduate school require: active synthesis of new understanding.

"Land Use Policy, Law, and the Environment","This undergraduate course is designed to provide students with an overview of the policy and legal implications of land development and use, focusing primarily on the environmental implications of public planning, policy-making, and law at the state and local levels. The course is framed around four general topics, each of which will be addressed specifically to environmental issues: the scientific and moral justifications for undertaking private and public land use management; the state and local institutional structures employed for managing land development and use in the U.S., focusing on planning, infrastructure policy, and regulation; the successes and failures of that state and local land management regime and corresponding efforts to reform it; and the ‘wise-use,’ ‘tea party,’ and other popular back-lash responses to land management reforms. 
Students will learn the substance of the topics described. They will also learn to read and brief legal cases related to land use law, to read and interpret local master plans, and to read and interpret local zoning codes.Course Requirements:Attendance and participation (15%), 2 1-page legal case briefs (10%), 4 short-answer exercises (20%), midterm exam (20%), planning commission meeting summary report (10%), final exam (25%)Intended Audience:This course is intended for undergraduate students who are contemplating careers in urban and regional planning, public policy analysis, environmental management, and law.

Restoration Ecology,"An introduction to the science, policy, and social issues around the ecological restoration. We consider fundamental questions about restoring natural areas: 


         What areas need to be restored? What should they be restored to, and how?  
 	What are some techniques for restoration? How do restoration ecologists use prescribed fire, and why?
 	Why should we restore natural areas? Why not just let nature be?
 	What about invasive species? How do they affect restoration work?
 	Who makes decisions about restoring natural areas? What is the legal and regulatory framework for restoration?
 	Who does the work of restoration, and who benefits from it? 
 	What does restoration mean in a changing world? If global warming is changing the environment, how can we figure out the goals and targets for restoration?


These questions will be addressed in lectures, readings, and by several guest lecturers — local restoration practitioners who will describe projects ranging from restoration of prairies and forests to endangered species habitat to dam removal.Course Requirements:Students will study a restoration issue of their choice in a written case study and class presentation. Students gain hands-on experience in restoration through participating in local restoration projects. Finally, the core of the classwork will be team projects to develop restoration and management plans for local clients including the Ann Arbor Natural Areas Program and the Washtenaw County Parks. Class Format:Discussion sections will feature field trips to visit local restoration projects and will also allow time for project site visits and team work.

Topics in Environmental Social Science,"This course explores how nature and human life is treated and valued in our current legal system and
looks to environmental rights as a legal tool to advance justice. The course first looks at how nature –
from animals and rivers to forests and the atmosphere – has been treated as commons and property in
our legal system. The resulting legal doctrines have repeatedly caused environmental destruction and
injustice. Similarly, we will explore how human lives and communities are subjected to and protected
from pollution. We will use a detailed case study of the failure of law and government in Flint, Michigan
, and the resulting drinking water crisis and poisoning of the city. We will conclude by looking at the hope
of Constitutional human and environmental rights to advance justice, along with alternative legal
approaches for nature, including public trust and legal personhood.


While the course does not provide a detailed survey of U.S. environmental law, it presents the
fundamental concepts to examine the status quo and need for change. Students will gain a deep and
conceptual understanding of modern environmental law — the values and assumptions it is based upon,
how it works (or doesn’t work) in various settings, and what must be changed for the law to play its
needed role in making a more just and sustainable society.Class Format:Learning Mode: All class meetings will be taught synchronously and In-Person for the Fall 2021 term.

Topics in Environmental Social Science,"Not everyone has equal access to abundant, healthy, diverse and affordable food. What factors influence who eats, what we eat and why we eat it? A powerful set of political, economic, social, environmental, and cultural factors motivate this most fundamental of human actions, eating! This course is an in-depth exploration of the complex system that shapes food systems at all scales: from farm to table, from local to global. We explore the politics and economics underlying public policies surrounding the production, processing, transportation, marketing and consumption of food. We consider how policies affect the environment, human health and well-being, giving special attention to the ways in which food policy can exacerbate or mitigate inequality. The course has four parts: Fundamentals of Food Production and Consumption; Political Economy of Food; How Food Policy Uplifts and Oppresses; and Wicked Problems for Food Policy.


The class will tackle several challenging questions including:


• What is the current state of food security in local and global context?

• How will demographic changes influence global supply and demand for food?

• What role do subsidies and trade policy play in shaping the supply and demand for food?

• Who governs food and agriculture locally and globally?

• What technological options are there for solving the problem of feeding the global population?

• How have the agribusiness, fast food, supermarket, and on-line shopping industries shaped public policy discourse and consumer behavior?

• Why do we observe the paradox of hunger and obesity in the same context?

• Does being a vegetarian or vegan, eating local, eating organic, and eating slow, catalyze policy change?

• How can we sustain current food supply given the constraints imposed by environmental degradation, water scarcity and climate change?


To explore these questions we give concerted attention to three kinds of food policy discourse:


• The analytical discourse of scientists (agricultural, social etc.) whose research contributes to solving food centered public policy problems;

• The discourse of policy makers charged with making decisions about how to influence actions for the public good in local, national and global food systems; and

• Advocacy narratives from a range of stakeholders used to influence food policy, food producers, and food consumers.


By the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and interrogate scholarship, policy dialogues, about popular press/social media claims about food policy and its expected outcomes. This is a reading and discussion intensive class.Intended Audience:Concentrators in any field of study are welcome, especially those who are interested in environmental and/or public health issues and seek to improve their analytical, writing and communication skills.Class Format:Learning Mode: All class meetings will be taught synchronously and In-Person for the Fall 2021 term.

Topics in Environmental Social Science,"Some scholars argue that we have entered a new geological epoch—the “Anthropocene”—characterized by unprecedented human alteration of global processes. This fast-paced global change both affects and is affected by agriculture. Concurrent food, energy, water, and climate crises, and a global rise in obesity amidst widespread hunger and undernutrition, have re-focused public attention on the deficiencies and complexities of the global food system. The dominant industrial food system has increasingly well-documented social, ecological, and health-related costs. Yet, a diversity of ‘alternative’ food systems demonstrates that agriculture can be resource-conserving, equitable, and health-promoting. Increasing food system sustainability requires interdisciplinarity along multiple dimensions: reconnecting agriculture with ecological systems, reshaping food production systems to be more nutrition-sensitive, and ensuring that policies and institutions that impact the food system safeguard social equity and the environment. Linking theory and practice is also essential, involving the diverse range of actors moving food from farm to fork. It is, therefore, not surprising that demand is growing for interdisciplinary scholars who are equipped to analyze and address the complex challenges of sustainable food production and global food and nutrition security. This course will offer a unique opportunity for students to gain interdisciplinary knowledge of food systems and to integrate theory and practice through experiential learning and dialogue-based inquiry both on campus and in the community. Interdisciplinary research and education require bridging worldviews and recognizing the values implicit in different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. This course will incorporate multiple perspectives, from the local to the global level, and an understanding of how those perspectives are underpinned by different epistemologies and value systems. That is, this course aims to directly engage with values, exploring how they shape food systems. Benefitting from collaborative interdisciplinary instruction that draws on the expertise of three professors from three different departments at the University of Michigan, students will develop competencies and cognitive skills in the area of food system sustainability including critical and systems thinking, creativity, and analytical ability.","Hoey,Lesli",ENVIRON,462,"Fall 2021, ",Section 005, - Foundations of Sustainable Food Systems,3,,,At least one environmentally related course prior to this class.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).  ,With permission of instructor.

Readings in French and Francophone Studies (in English Translation),"This course seeks to familiarize students with the complex and multifaceted tradition of Marxist theory and practice while also tracing Marxism’s role in some of today’s most vibrant political movements.

Special focus will be directed at Marxist analyses that attend to (and also sometimes fail to attend to) the interpenetration of class, race, and gender. Key figures for the course include: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, V. I. Lenin, Clara Zetkin, Mao Tse-Tung, Louis Althusser, Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, José Carlos Mariátegui, José María Arguedas, Álvaro García Linera, Raquel Guttiérez, Subcomandante Marcos, and Silvia Federici.","Arnall,Gavin",FRENCH,444,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Comparative Marxism,3,,,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

First-Year Film Seminar,"Science fiction is often just that – fiction. But in a world in which artificial intelligence has made commercial space travel a reality and a humanoid robot has been granted citizenship, science fiction becomes something else entirely. This first-year seminar will explore the emergence of artificial intelligence alongside the genre of science fiction. Popular culture influences science and science influences popular culture. Our objective in this course will be to interrogate the relationship between science and storytelling. In order to do this, we will study the history of ideas about A.I. in the western world as well as its technical development. We will study science fiction as an incredibly old and influential genre of media and literary texts. We will consider the burning questions that sci-fi and A.I. share – what does it mean to be human? Can life be replaced, enhanced, or custom designed? Is faster and smarter always better? Can we alter time and space? Weekly seminars include screenings of film, TV, art, and literature and friendly debate about how these art forms grapple with the everyday presence of technology in our lives.","Murray, Sarah  ",FTVM,190,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - From Sci-Fi to AI: Media and Artificial Intelligence,3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

The course also introduces students to Israel as an immigrant society and to the cinematic representation of Jewish and Arab minority groups. Throughout the course, we reflect on casting choices, language use and subtitling, cross-dressing, and genre choices, as these affect the cinematic construction of Jewishness in relationship to other social groups.","Barzilai,Maya",FTVM,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Movie/Serial Television Production I,"This course prepares you for a lifetime of sustainable creative work in Movies and TV. Movies and TV are made by crews working collaboratively across Writing, the seven production departments (Producing, Production Design, Directing, Directing Photography, Lighting, Camera Operation & Sound) plus Editing. If you want a career in the movies or TV, you need to know these departments, what they do, and how they collaborate. This course starts you on that path through collaboratively producing movies/TV teasers both in-class and out of class. You will work in a team in at least 2 production departments as well as Editing and possibly Writing. Out of class, you will make, with your team, two short Movies/TV teasers. In class, you will also make shorter scenes with lots of hands-on assistance learning how the set works and how everyone’s contribution adds to the project. This experience will teach you how movies and TV are actually made—what the decision processes are; what each department contributes; how the vision of the program is determined and implemented; how to manage the logistics of production, production equipment, and personnel; how to effectively work with actors; and the completion process of the program for the audience. Skills and experience in any one area are valuable, but understanding the collaborative and integrated nature of how an idea makes it to the screen is necessary for success in the realm of TV and Movies. FTVM 400, TV Pilots and 423 take you further—competence and excellence come only with making media, learning from your successes and mistakes, and putting what you have learned to the test in your next, higher level, production.","Rayher,Robert W",FTVM,300,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Students who take this course can expect to gain not only a firm grasp of the major figures and movements in Iran's cinematic history, but also exposure to some major theoretical approaches within this field: formal analysis, genre, gender, and the gaze, the role of women behind and before the camera, the formation of modern subjectivity, political media work, postcolonial studies, hyphenation and hybridity, and the global frameworks of ""(inter-)national,"" ""(third-)world,"" and ""accented"" cinema","Cross,Cameron",FTVM,321,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Fascist Cinemas,"This course explores the fascist-era cinemas of Germany, Italy, and Japan. We will analyze important films from the era at weekly screenings, and will study historical documents and critical essays to help us understand the context. After we’ve defined some terms and covered some basic history at the beginning of the semester, the course focuses on a set of common themes to identify both commonalities and specificities of a given context or historical moment. The themes include: fascist aesthetics; nation, “Volk,” race, ethnicity; anti-Semitism; youth and movement; the exalted leader; propaganda and spectacle; entertainment and pleasure; film style; bodies and genders; war fronts and home fronts; and post-fascist visual culture.","Nornes, Markus  ",FTVM,333,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, HU, RE",,FTVM 150 or FTVM (SAC) 236.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Media Matter: From Print to Screen Culture,"Media determine our situation. This course explores their history. How have technologies such as photography, film, radio, and the computer altered the human senses, our relationship to space and time, to each other, to institutions and governments? In what ways do new technologies shape the questions we ask about the natural world and the answers we give? How have critical approaches for thinking about media evolved over the past two hundred years, and what contributions have German-speaking thinkers in particular made to media theory? Drawing on a wide range of materials including scholarly articles, primary documents, photographs, films, literary texts, and audio recordings, we will work to develop a critical vocabulary and historical framework for analyzing the varied and widely distributed effects of technological change on both patterns of thought and physical reality, the imagination and the body, social relations, and their material networks and infrastructures. Topics include the so-called ‘reading revolution’ in late eighteenth-century Europe, print culture and the Enlightenment, human mediumship, spiritualism, and the occult, technology, and science, sound recording and the voice, radio and the Third Reich, cyborgs, and the ‘post-human,’ automation and surveillance, democracy and digital activism.","Whitney,Tyler",FTVM,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

"Italian Film: History, Art, Entertainment","Throughout its history, Italian cinema has inspired aesthetic innovations and theoretical reflections by consistently engaging with such international cinematic conventions as realism, the art film, and genre productions. And it has done so by correlating national and regional high art forms (i.e., opera, music, literature, and painting) and plebeian entertainment forms (i.e., circus, vaudeville, burlesque, dialect theatre, and popular songs) with politically motivated needs to explore and revisit the country’s history and identity. Focusing on the post-WWII period, this course looks at Italian cinema from a number of perspectives: political, commercial, social, and aesthetic. Firstly, we will examine the controversial poetic and political claims of neorealism (De Sica, Zavattini, Visconti). Secondly, we will look at the commercially successful modern productions of the 1960s and 1970s, which addressed crucial moments of Italian political and cultural history, from Fascism (Bertolucci, Cavani, Fellini) to the radical changes following the nation’s economic boom affecting the social structure and life (Pasolini, Olmi) as well as gender relationships (Antonioni, Wertmüller). The course will also look at two highly profitable film genres, Italian western and terror films (Leone, Argento, Bava), which over the years have become objects of international cult. Toward the end of the course, we will study the post-1990s consolidation of authorship, in its various facets, male comedy, Sicilian cinéphilia, immigrants’ drama, and Holocaust subversion (Benigni), and recent television productions of great international success, from Gomorra and Suburra to the comedies of Virzì and Zalone.","Bertellini,Giorgio",FTVM,358,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Women of color feminist filmmaking imagines futures for people who fight patriarchy without the shield of whiteness.


This course introduces students to some of the major films and theories in U.S. women of color feminist thinking, filmmaking, and artmaking from the 1970s to the present. We will not engage with material that merely depicts or represents women of color as objects of study. Instead, we’ll read essays and view films that theorize the aesthetic, social, and political differences made by various WOC perspectives.

"Topics in Film, Television and Popular Culture","Media is a powerful tool. The term “media activism” refers to how media is used to campaign for or bring about social or political change. This class will primarily focus on how underrepresented identity-based and cause-based groups in the United States have used different kinds of media forms and practices in the service of social justice activism. We will examine various social movements, including AIDS activism, Black Lives Matter, the anti-war movement, Palestine solidarity, and Occupy Wall Street, and examine the media texts and practices these movements employ, such as culture jamming, street art, documentary, and narrative film, film festivals, public television, social media, and memes. We will read interdisciplinary texts from the fields of film and media studies, critical race and ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, and postcolonial studies to interrogate the relationships between representation and power, and to identify how and why certain forms of media activism emerge at particular historical moments.","Cable, Umayyah  ",FTVM,366,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004, - Media Activism,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

"Topics in Film, Television and Popular Culture","For decades Westerns were Hollywood’s most popular genre, appealing to people worldwide.  This extraordinary popularity fell off in the United States in the 1970s largely due to the effect of the Vietnam war on our notions of heroism and of good and evil. The 1990s, however, showed a renewed interest in Westerns—two won Academy Awards for best picture during that decade: Dances with Wolves (1990) and The Unforgiven (1992).  Every major Hollywood male star acted in Westerns: Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda, John Wayne, James Stewart, Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner.  In this course, we will analyze many of the classics: Stagecoach, The Ox-Bow Incident, Red River, Shane, High Noon, One-Eyed Jacks, The Wild Bunch, Once Upon a Time in the West, Tombstone, Butch Cassidy, and the Sundance Kid, The Wild Bunch, and  Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid, to mention just a few.


We will critique these films as dramas — their stories, characters, and structures. We will also consider what it is about Westerns that still speak to us. We will also examine the Western’s concept of heroism and masculinity, how the genre has used women, and how women’s roles have changed over the decades.","Cohen,Hubert I",FTVM,366,"Fall 2021, ",Section 005, - The Western,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

"Topics in Film, Television and Popular Culture","In this course, you learn how to think and write about reality television like a media scholar. Few elements of media culture are as loved or as hated as much as reality programs. Rather than debate whether or not reality television is “good” or “bad” for us, you learn the more rigorous approaches that researchers take when they examine and write about reality television. Specifically, this course provides you with opportunities to practice researching and writing about how reality programs construct social norms, especially how they suggest to viewers that there are proper and improper lifestyles. Through screenings, discussions, readings, and writing assignments, you engage with others’ ideas in order to perform analyses of your own. To do that, you conduct what media scholars call “close readings,” or meticulous analyses in which you identify and then articulate how the stories told in episodes of reality television programs reveal information about the world around us. Far more than “trash,” reality television shines a light on the contemporary U.S., suggesting a great deal about who we are as a people and what drives us as a culture.","Griffin, Hollis  ",FTVM,366,"Fall 2021, ",Section 007, - Reality Television,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Topics in Digital Media Studies,"This class will examine both representations of identity and the lived experiences of users online. During the early history of the Internet, gender play and experimentation were practiced in many ways, from games to seemingly non-fictional self-representations. Despite this sense of free play, representations of online gender often became stereotypical, shoring up categories like ""geek"" and ""cute"" in, particularly technological contexts. While we no longer live in an era when the Internet is an anonymous place, online cultures still celebrate identity and representation. This course takes a media studies approach that is informed by cultural studies, material history, and cultural ethnography.


Along the way, we’ll study selfies, profiles, social media platforms, online socialities, race, gender, class, sexuality, labor, toxic geeks, cyberfeminisms, trolls, glitter, cuteness, Black Twitter, virtual signaling, and many more complex ways we make and are made within digital media culture. In this seminar-style course, we will endeavor to understand how Internet users and cultures express, represent, and gives us an opportunity to consider how identities are made. Two key questions will guide us: How are online selves worn and performed? How do social forces like platforms and communities shape our understanding of online identities?","Murphy,Sheila C",FTVM,368,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Internet of Identities,3,,,FTVM/DIGITAL 367.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Studies in Transnational Media,"Narcotrafficking and the U.S./Mexico border have remained at the center of political and cultural debate in the United States for over three decades. These topics have also become staples of the contemporary mediascape, from journalistic reporting to horror films and streaming content. The point of departure for this course is the documentary series The Day I Met El Chapo, which is representative of Netflix’s heavy reliance on narcotrafficking for various genres of programming. The course is intended to provide a historical and media industrial context for the recent explosion of such productions, including the creation and distribution of media between the U.S. and Latin America; narco cinema and the Mexican film industry; gender, class, race, and transnational stardom; visualizations of the U.S/Mexico border; drug trafficking narratives; the history of Latina/o media representation; the historical and contemporary immigration debate; and the digital and industrial landscape that has fostered the proliferation of narco-related content. By returning to The Day I Met El Chapo as a touchstone over the course of the semester, the course is also intended to give students the experience and skill set required to analyze a single media text from multiple perspectives.","Gunckel,Colin",FTVM,380,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Day I Met El Chapo,3,,,"Prior coursework in Film Television, and Media, Communications (TV), or Latino Studies.

Examining the relationships between socio-historical contexts, images, and industry discourse, we will also consider the intertwined questions of race, nation, gender, and stereotype through case studies of individual stars, from Carmen Miranda to Sofia Vergara. While analyzing representations of Latina/os in mainstream film and television, the course also considers the broad range of media through which Latina/os have represented themselves: experimental film, documentary, the alternative press, social media, and music cultures. Through this survey of cultural production, students will become versed in histories of immigration, various modes of media activism, the relation of Latina/os to conceptions of race, the diverse experiences of different national origin groups, and contemporary issues facing this population.","Gunckel,Colin",FTVM,381,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Editing Theory and Practice,"With a focus on craft and theory, this class will explore editing as the third and final ""authoring"" of a motion picture.

Using Adobe Premiere Pro and professionally produced footage from TV, Feature Films and Documentaries, students will be challenged with 6 editing assignments designed to provide valuable experience with a variety of techniques and multiple modes of production. In addition to considering image editing, we will also cover sound sweetening and basic sound design work. With the belief that the best way to learn to edit is to edit as much as possible, there will be hands-on demos and every student will be creating their own edited version of the footage for each assignment. Again, this is not a software class, this is a class about creative choices and will focus on the challenges every editor's faces while providing historical, theoretical, and methodological approaches to those challenges through lectures, demos, discussion, critique, and hands-on experience.","Marek,David Kenneth",FTVM,391,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,CE,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Screenwriting II: The Rewrite,"This course focuses on the most important step in learning to write a screenplay: rewriting. The class is designed to help students embrace the extremely difficult lesson of ""letting go"" of material from their first drafts in order to improve their work. The semester begins with students casting a critical eye on their fellow students' screenplays. Working in teams, students will be taught to break down screenplays in terms of their six fundamental elements: character, story, structure, theme, dialogue, and visuals. Using feedback from their fellow students and instructor, students will devise a new game plan for their second drafts and then execute it by meeting a series of writing deadlines. Students will understand that the rewriting process does not end with the completion of their second drafts. Students can expect detailed notes from their instructor for their third drafts should they choose to write one. Ultimately, students will learn that ""writing is rewriting."" The hope is that once students internalize the rewriting process, they will understand it is applicable to disciplines and endeavors beyond screenwriting. It is the difference between doing good work and great work.","Burnstein,James S",FTVM,410,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,FTVM 310 and FTVM concentrators.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Students study and review well-known pilots with an eye towards how they accomplish the goals of a pilot: to tell a good stand-alone story while creating the potential for a whole world of continuing stories and characters that can be sustained over multiple seasons. They then compile a 6-7 page ""pitch bible"", comprised of a series overview, character profiles, and future episode ideas, then produce a first draft of the script. During the course, students will often be involved in workshop sessions, critiquing one another's work.","Leahy,Janet Marie",FTVM,411,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,FTVM 290 and 310.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
TV Pilot Production,"FTVM 421 TV Pilots is a hands-on production/writing/ course in which students write and produce a full-length TV Pilot.

Students are admitted from any U of M unit based on appropriate skills; by the permission of the instructor. This course prepares you for a lifetime of sustainable creative work in TV and Movies. TV and Movies are made by crews working collaboratively across Writing, the seven production departments (Producing, Art Dept: “Production Design”, Directing, Directing Photography, Lighting, Camera Operation & Sound) plus Editing. The goal of the course is to provide the screenwriters, the actors, and the production crew with the most integrated production environment possible. The writers re-write based on feedback from the actors, production crew, and table readings of the scripts. The production crew works closely with the writer and actors to produce the full-length Pilot. Students pitch for positions on the productions in late March or early April. The course starts by workshopping advanced drafts of the telescript and the writers perfect them over the first few weeks. During this process, the production team and actors develop an in-depth production design based on an intimate knowledge of the script. Working with the actors the script will be rehearsed, and the production design, directorial, cinematographic, and acting approaches will be revised and developed as necessary to convey the full meaning of the script to the screen. As the scenes are shot the editors present rough cuts and the short is finished in time for a showing at Lightworks in December.","Thornton,Oliver Reid",FTVM,421,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

The course will examine this massive culture industry and its circulation in the global space as a unique cultural form. The first part of the course will cover the early history of Bollywood and pay close attention to the aesthetics of Bollywood film; what makes this cinema unique? The second part will hone in on the socio-cultural and industrial logic of Bollywood’s global presence and circulation by focusing on specific case studies such as the U.S, U.K, Russia, and China. What constitutes the transnational appeal of Bollywood film culture? We will also try to understand this complex term Bollywood by focusing on globalization and its impact on cinematic representations of nation, family, diaspora, religion, gender, relationships, and cultural traditions. How did Indian Hindi Cinema morph into Bollywood?

Intensive Elementary Course,"Intensive German I covers the first year of German language study in one semester. The goal of this course is to provide students with a basic but solid knowledge of grammatical structures and syntax, a functional vocabulary, familiarity with intonation patterns and native pronunciation, and practice in speaking and writing. At the end of German Intensive I, students can understand authentic and literary texts appropriate to the level and short spoken passages without glossed vocabulary, they can write an essay or short story without the aid of a dictionary, and they can converse on a range of general topics.  This course, like all RC German language courses, is conducted in German, so students quickly become accustomed to using German for daily activities.  Students in RC Lang 191 have many opportunities to gain facility with the language by speaking with more advanced learners and teachers in the program in informal settings, such as RC German lunch tables and coffee hours.  In addition, they are introduced to web activities and films to help them explore aspects of German language and culture.  In the Winter semester, the course is geared to students who have little or no prior exposure to the language.","Cribari-Assali,Carla",GERMAN,100,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,8,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

First Year Seminar,"

This course will consider how literature, art, and films produced by minority artists challenge our understanding of what it means to be German. Whereas Germanness has historically been associated with whiteness and Christianity, we will ask, for example, what it means to be Black, Jewish, or Muslim and German. We will examine the question of what it means to be, or to become German from multiple angles. As course materials show, becoming German is not simply a process of fitting in or acting in a certain way. It can also be a process of actively decentering cultural norms that have worked to exclude minorities for centuries.Course Requirements:Students will undertake a range of appropriate assignments including the regular analysis of fiction and scholarly readings, film and other materials; develop techniques for writing a research paper; and two, one-hour exams (no final exam).","Dickinson,Kristin",GERMAN,180,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Race and Ethnicity in Postwar Germany,3,HU,FYSem,"No knowledge of German is required.

Germany’s role in the EU? the current debates surrounding the admission of refugees?

Topics in German Culture and the Arts,"This is a course about memory studies using the case study of modern Germany and its relation to the Roman past. We will explore how German philosophers, literary authors, and painters thought about their present through the lens of the Roman past. The issues that this involves are the construction of national/imperial identity; but also, more specifically, the re-appropriation of the opposition of Roman conqueror versus “barbarian”; and the inter-textual and inter-visual presence of ancient texts, works of art, and architecture. We will read essays by Karl Marx, Ernest Renan, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and other authors in order to create our intellectual framework for memory studies.

Topics in German Culture and the Arts,"

Nature and the environment feature prominently in the philosophy and cultural traditions of the German-speaking world—from the deification of nature within Romantic poetry and painting, through the blood-and-soil ideology of the Nazis, to the land art of Joseph Beuys and Hans Haacke during the Cold War. Today, German, Austrian, and Swiss people are considered some of the world’s most environmentally conscious, a fact reflected in the extent to which environmental issues currently shape the political agendas of their respective countries.

While it may sound like it should belong exclusively to political or scientific activity, ecocriticism is environmentally focused criticism practiced by producers of literature, film, art, and theory. American films like the Mad Max Trilogy, The Day After Tomorrow, or Pixar’s WALL-E are popular earlier examples of the post-apocalyptic genre that has exploded in the last five years, and which arguably participates in ecocriticism by imagining the worlds that might exist after environmental collapse; novels like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road or Emily St. John Mandel’s Station 11 are examples of a similar strain of criticism in English-language literature.

In this course we will examine ecocriticism’s history and the appearance and disappearance of environmental themes in German-language literature, film, and art over the course of the last two centuries. We will read and learn about: the Anthropocene and Industrial Revolution, Alexander von Humboldt, J. W. Goethe, and Goethean science, Novalis, German Romanticism and the philosophy of nature, Adalbert Stifter, Ernst Haeckel and the reception of Darwinism in Germany, Wilhelm Riehl, Franz Kafka, the Blue Rider group, Martin Heidegger, the Frankfurt School, Ingeborg Bachmann, Joseph Beuys, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Elfriede Jelinek, Herta Müller, Sharon Dodua Otoo, Carl Amery and Germany’s Green Party, Yoko Tawada, Werner Herzog, Dorothee Elmiger and the European migration crisis, ecothriller film and more.

Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) and Frau im Mond (1929) as well as Alfred Doeblin's Berge Meere und Giganten (1924) reflect a general interest in the genre before World War II. After the war the genre fills with English language titles from such masters as Heinlein, Asimov and Tolkien. Yet there existed a lively audience for science fiction in the 1950's with such publications as Terra and Perry Rhodan. From the 1970's onward, German science fiction and fantasy once again gains traction in regional bookstores and theaters, but rarely garners the international acclaim or status of the aforementioned English language titles.","Rodena-Krasan,Mary",GERMAN,325,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - German Science Fiction/Fantasy,3,,,GERMAN 230 or 232 or RCLANG 291 or the equivalent as per placement test results.,Taught in German.,May be elected twice for credit.

While this unfolding situation is global in scale, ecological in character, and dynamic in terms of its volatility, the study of honeybees and their behavior also can be intensely local and strangely joyous, intimate, mysterious, and captivating.

Media Matter: From Print to Screen Culture,"Media determine our situation. This course explores their history. How have technologies such as photography, film, radio, and the computer altered the human senses, our relationship to space and time, to each other, to institutions and governments? In what ways do new technologies shape the questions we ask about the natural world and the answers we give? How have critical approaches for thinking about media evolved over the past two hundred years, and what contributions have German-speaking thinkers in particular made to media theory? Drawing on a wide range of materials including scholarly articles, primary documents, photographs, films, literary texts, and audio recordings, we will work to develop a critical vocabulary and historical framework for analyzing the varied and widely distributed effects of technological change on both patterns of thought and physical reality, the imagination and the body, social relations, and their material networks and infrastructures. Topics include the so-called ‘reading revolution’ in late eighteenth-century Europe, print culture and the Enlightenment, human mediumship, spiritualism, and the occult, technology, and science, sound recording and the voice, radio and the Third Reich, cyborgs, and the ‘post-human,’ automation and surveillance, democracy and digital activism.","Whitney,Tyler",GERMAN,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.,

"Sports, Politics, and Society","Few things have characterized mass culture in the 20th century more consistently and thoroughly than sports. Particularly in their team variety, there is not one industrial country in the world that does not possess at least one major team sport which has attained hegemonic dimensions in that country’s culture in the course of the previous century. There can simply be no doubt that team sports as a form of mass culture have been among the most essential ingredients of public life in the 20th century. If anything, their cultural importance has increased in the beginning years of the 21st. Indeed, all indications are that this importance will grow in years to come. Why has this been the case? And how did this happen? Moreover, why did the United States deviate from much of the rest of the industrial world not in terms of the presence of such sports, but in their number and kind? Briefly put, why are baseball, football, and basketball (as well as ice hockey to a certain extent) the hegemonic team sports that defined American mass culture throughout the 20th century whereas no other industrial country has more than two such hegemonic team sports, most often indeed only one — soccer? Why has this sports map remained so stable throughout a highly volatile and ever-changing century? Will this stability persist into the new millennium or will new forces challenge these hegemonic sports and contest them in their respective cultural space? Will the United States become a major soccer power and will Americans be glued to events in this sport as they have been in those of baseball, football, basketball, and hockey for many decades? And, conversely, will soccer-obsessed Europeans come to love basketball and other American sports as much as they have loved soccer? Lastly, will China incorporate both sports cultures and excel at one or the other — or even both — eventually surpassing its American and European teachers? And what about the massive proliferation of video-based and Internet-driven sports phenomena that are scrambling all of the aforementioned phenomena?","Markovits,Andrei S",GERMAN,379,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, SS",,One introductory course in sociology or political science.,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.,

We will also read important scholarship on the Grimms’ tales, while at the same time placing them within larger interpretive contexts such as psychoanalysis, structural anthropology, Marxist social critique, feminism, and Jungian psychology. Both the “iconography” and the “archaeology” of the fairy tale will be explored, as will the relationship between folk tales and at tales such as Shakespeare’s Tempest and Mozart’s Magic Flute.","Amrine,Frederick R",GERMAN,386,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
The Holocaust,"
The Holocaust — the persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945 — was one of the most horrific events in the history of the world. The atrocities committed in the heart of the twentieth-century threw into question the very notion of human progress, and continue to haunt humanity to this day. We have all seen images and films about the Holocaust, or have read literature and diaries from the time, but mostly we shy away from confronting the bigger questions that the Holocaust forces us to ask about ourselves and our history. This course will better equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to interpret representations of the Holocaust by grounding students with the factual basis on which these representations are made.  Students will learn to interpret some of the most important historical facts about the Holocaust, to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of contending explanations regarding the causes and effects of the Holocaust, and to contextualize the Holocaust.Course Requirements:Students will be evaluated on the basis of quizzes, writing assignments, and exams.Intended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:The course will be structured as a lecture with discussions.","Mays,Devi Elizabeth",GERMAN,391,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.,

This course surveys the historical avant-gardes of the early twentieth century, presenting them as a rich interconnected network that encompassed East and West. Italian Futurism, German Dadaism, French Surrealism and their impact on East-European avant-gardes will be discussed in detail; in turn, the impact of Soviet Constructivism and Czech Surrealism will be examined. Special issues will include the role of language, new mass media, and technology. Other topics include the women artists of the avant-garde, manifesto as a genre, New Typography, and the avant-garde conception of the book. Avant-gardes and interwar politics will be a constant theme.

Special Topics in English Translation,"This course will look at contemporary German politics through the prism of history. It will explore the main political, social, cultural, and economic features and issues of the Federal Republic of Germany in a European context. By analyzing previous political regimes that governed Germany just in the 20th century — absolute monarchy, unstable liberal democracy, totalitarian fascism, stable liberal democracy, bureaucratic communism — the course will shed light on the vicissitudes of the ""German Question"" and its importance for European politics as a whole. We will look at Germany’s domestic developments and also its relations with other countries, most notably those in Europe, east and west, the United States and the Soviet Union (Russia). In terms of the country’s domestic scene, we will focus on the main actors and purveyors of political life — the political parties and their world. We will look at these parties' history, structures, colors, ideologies, personalities, policies, slogans, leaders and prospects. We will anchor each of these parties in their proper historical context. We will also study societal developments in Germany that have happened outside the parties. In particular, we will look at social movements and interest groups that have played a major role in the transformation of German public life over the past 60 some years. Lastly, we will feature Germany’s contemporary political life in the context of the European Union, arguably among the greatest and most exciting state-building processes of our time.","Markovits,Andrei S",GERMAN,449,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - German Politics in Europe Since 1945,3,ULWR,,,Taught in English.,May be elected three times for credit.

German Honors Proseminar,"
Completion of the sequence of GERMAN 491 and 492 is required for an Honors concentration in German Studies. Interested students are encouraged to contact the Honors concentration advisor for admission into the program (minimum 3.4 GPA with at least 3.7 in German) for Fall Term of their senior year, preferably —  but not necessarily —  as early as Winter Term of their sophomore year. GERMAN 491 is regarded as a seminar-style preparatory course (facilitated by one faculty member for all honors students)  in anticipation of GERMAN 492 (Winter), in which each student concludes the Honors thesis with the support of an individual thesis advisor. The kinds of work to be read in GERMAN 491 will be determined in part by the perceived needs of the students, geared possibly toward already-identified thesis topics and/or toward an intensified focus on reading literary and scholarly texts, acquiring and honing interdisciplinary research skills, and developing a persuasive and sustained argument. Every effort will be made to accommodate students with a broad range of interests from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds.","Barndt,Kerstin",GERMAN,491,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Research,3,,Honors,Senior Honors standing.,"Continuing Course.

Old English,"This course is an introduction to Old English, the language spoken by our forebears until the unpleasantness at Hastings — the Norman Conquest.  Since Old English is so different from Modern English as to seem like another language, the greatest effort of this class will be to master the rudiments of the structure and vocabulary of the earliest attested form of English.  The reward is being able to read an excitingly different corpus of prose and poetry.  You will also develop a new appreciation of where our language, culture, and intellectual traditions come from.  Course requirements:  daily recitation, weekly quizzes, two-hour exams, a term project (written and oral presentation).  Written work also includes regular short modernizations and longer take-home modernizations.","Toon,Thomas E",GERMAN,501,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Introduction to German Studies,"This course will cover a range of seminal texts, media and approaches that have proven important in recent German Studies debates. Gender, race/ethnicity, material culture, visual studies, the relationship of aesthetics and politics, memory, issues of representation/media/remediation, and methodology are at the forefront of these considerations. To this end, the course endeavors to provide exemplary analyses of key literary genres (novels, poetry, short story, essay), visual arts such as painting and photography, communication strategies of museums and exhibitions, and film. To help develop a set of recurrent issues, texts and materials have been selected so that questions of bodies, things/materiality, and considerations of representation can be revisited from different perspectives. While historical knowledge and perspectives are important considerations, they are leveraged by texts and materials produced in the 20th and 21st centuries.","Whitney,Tyler",GERMAN,540,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,Permission of instructor.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Elementary Greek,"In this course you will learn first semester classical Greek. Ancient Greek was not the language spoken in fraternities, but the equivalent of English in the ancient Western world: the universal language in which the alphabet, democracy, science, philosophy, medicine, history-writing, and political science were invented, and the language of some of the greatest literature in the history of the world. Whether you are fired up by Greek myth, the epics of Homer, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides, the comedies of Aristophanes, the writings of philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, or whether you want to read the New Testament in its original form, this language is for you. Greek opens up a much deeper understanding of English, since it lies at the basis of 20% of our vocabulary, and most of the terms used in science and medicine.

Great Books,"In this course, we’ll read a series of works from Greco-Roman antiquity long held to be among the “Great Books” of world literature. We’ll explore the ways in which these texts can still speak to us today because of their remarkably intense focus on central questions of human existence, such as: What makes you who you are? What makes a good life? What is justice? What is your relation to people different from yourself, whether because of their ethnicity, class, or gender? At the same time, however, we’ll ask why these texts, in particular, became “Great Books” because of the answers they provide to these questions, and whether these answers are still our answers. Students will, in addition, have the opportunity to write about modern books and films that are related to the ancient texts but come from diverse perspectives and national traditions.","Dufallo,Basil J",GTBOOKS,191,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, FYWR",Honors,First-Year students in the Honors Program.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

First Year Seminar,"Ever notice the earth beneath your feet, and think about how large it is? How old? Or what of the water that pours from the tap to refill your S'well bottle? It doesn't pour from every tap, though it covers three-quarters of the planet's surface, rising and falling through air in a cycle that existed long before human beings ever did. The elements— Earth, Air, Water, and an energy that, for now, we'll call Fire—are so vast and ordinary we rarely recognize them as being there at all, let alone think about them. Yet they are material things we can perceive and engage; they surround us, dwell inside us, unite and separate us, and challenge our imaginations. This course will introduce you to a few of the many and diverse ways African people imagine the elements— including the elemental, philosophical stuff of personhood— and how they transform them (and are transformed by them, too) into objects and images more readily scaled to human perception and experience. The objects and images speak of death and rebirth, power and suffering, ancestors, gods, and monsters. They detail the events of past and future histories, and mark the shifting, anxious present, as humans engage their changing environment. Some of these objects, like their creators, propose to reckon with perceptions of time and space that extend beyond the human— as if the earth, say, were to think about you and your S'well bottle.","Doris,David T",HISTART,194,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Elements In / Of African Art,3,HU,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",May not be used to meet the prerequisite requirement for the History of Art major.,May not be repeated for credit.,
First Year Seminar,"In this seminar students will select an object of material/visual culture that has some kind of special allure and cultural significance, or strong personal and sentimental associations, and investigate it over the course of the semester, discovering its provenance, history, and relative value. This object can be something in your or your family's possession that you are curious about, or have strong feelings about, or something that you encounter on campus in a museum or in Ann Arbor, during the early weeks of the course. Playing off the popular PBS television program, ""The Antiques Roadshow,"" where people have family heirlooms and personal collectables analyzed and assessed by experts, this seminar will allow you both to assume this expert role and to critique this form of cultural valuation and consumption. We will be particularly interested in the various phases in the ""lives"" of cultural objects, investigating their manufacture and original use and value, and then their subsequent circulation, repurposing, and revaluation. You will learn how to conduct the necessary historical research on your object, and there will be weekly readings assigned and group discussions about visual art, material culture, and collecting practices. There will be an emphasis on community building and experiential learning, as we share experiences and ideas within the seminar group and make use of campus collections and local Ann Arbor resources.

Gender and Popular Culture,"Gender and popular culture are interrelated social constructs that have a profound impact on our everyday lives.  Movies, TV, magazines, and the internet not only reflect what it means to be a man or woman today, they also inform those identities.  This course will focus on the visual aspects of these phenomena and survey key methods for interpreting them, including the gaze, queer theory, radical feminist theory, Foucauldean theory, and issues of socioeconomic status. We will apply these theories to examples of contemporary American culture from Instagram and Bar Stool Sports to the suburban home and Beyonce.  This process will also allow us to debate questions like: Does gender have to be binary?  How does gender affect the experience of space?  Is the availability of pornography affecting our ideas of gender?  Why is child rearing such a contested domain?  How does racial identity influence gender norms?  And perhaps most importantly, who is missing from popular representations of gender?","Crasnow,Sascha M",HISTART,211,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Introduction to Roman Archaeology,"Ancient Rome and its monuments have inspired many — artists and armies, writers and rebels, scholars and cinematographers — to create images of ruthless emperors, downtrodden slaves, or gluttonous diners.

In lectures, discussion, and original hands-on-research, we will examine the work of such celebrated figures as Frank Lloyd Wright, Jacob Lawrence, Georgia O'Keeffe, Isamu Noguchi, Edward Hopper, Walker Evans, Andy Warhol, and Diego Rivera, but also the culture of consumerism and emergent racial and ethnic identities— in media from painting to furniture to photography to graphic design and propaganda posters—in which they worked.

Italian Renaissance Art,"Italian Renaissance visual art surfaces in the news media and in contemporary culture in spectacular ways. In 2018 a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci sold on the art market for an astonishing 450 million dollars. The Piazza San Marco in Venice appears in news footage underwater, the city said to be sinking and its fragile lagoon ecosystem threatened by colossal cruise ships. In this course, we take this evidence of the enduring visibility and relevance of Italian Renaissance art as a starting point for an in-depth survey of the period of art, 1300-1550. We examine how the works of artists like Giotto, Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo came to be regarded as so important in the history of art and valuable as cultural artifacts. Why, even within the artists' lifetimes, was their art consider to signal the ""rebirth"" of painting and sculpture and what Michelangelo called ""the divine""? But we also take these celebrated practitioners off their pedestals and apply a contextual approach to the principal Renaissance monuments— Giotto's Arena Chapel, Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, Michelangelo's David, and Sistine Chapel Ceiling, among other works. Connectivity between Italy and other European and global regions is explored through the circulation of artists, works of art, artistic technologies, and materials. The assignments include a 6-7 page paper and two examinations. Attendance of the lectures and the weekly section is required.","Holmes,Megan L",HISTART,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Special Topics,"War and violence permeate modern media, from cinema to online games. But war and its materializations in artistic realms have deep cultural histories the world over. Just as technologies and strategies of war constitute forms of art, so has warfare and its social surroundings produced a broad array of artistic materials. This course will discuss an array of accouterments and visual narratives of war through comparative case studies across the globe. Students will delve into ancient worlds, and progress through medieval and modern ones engrossed in warfare, exploring a variety of material arts, including weapons, household items, machines, paintings, sculptures, posters, and buildings.","Miller,Bryan",HISTART,294,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Arts of War,3,HU,,,,May be elected three times for credit.  ,

The Moving Image in the Middle Ages,"Byzantine art has been both condemned and praised for its static nature and flat surfaces. This course examines contexts in which the Byzantine icon disproves the traditional notion (or burden) of stillness imposed upon it. These contexts range from the public arena of processions in which icons (images) were the center of visual attention, to the walls of Byzantine churches and palaces where they performed, to the miracles in which they supposedly came ""alive"". The responses of Byzantine viewers also reveal modes in which the viewing process shook icons out of their boundaries, transforming, even distorting them. By examining these issues, we may begin to understand the nuanced nature of the Byzantine icon other than as an epitome of stillness. The readings for this course include primary sources (all translated) in the form of deliciously evocative poems, epigrams, and sermons.","Chatterjee,Paroma",HISTART,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Global Politics and Contemporary Art,"The end of World War II saw a dramatic shift in how the idea of a ""world"" was understood, particularly by visual artists and their viewers. Focusing on art after 1945, this course will examine artistic production and reception under various forms of authoritarian rule. Special emphasis will be given to artistic production in countries newly liberated from Western and Japanese imperial rule. Given the vast scope of this subject, this course will adopt a case study model. Included among the anticipated case studies are works made during the rule of Léopold Senghor in Senegal, the interventions of Cildo Meireles in post-1964 Brazil, and ink painting in Maoist China. At the broadest level, this course is itself a case study that seeks to explore different ways of understanding art's manifold relationships to various modes of social regulation categorized under the rubric of politics.

Dada and Surrealism,"This course examines the international movements of Dada and Surrealism within the context of European and American culture and history between 1916 and 1939. These artistic movements, which were influenced by the formal experiments of early twentieth-century art and literature, redirected the self-reflexive radicalism of their artistic predecessors in new directions; namely, toward: (1) bridging the gap between art and life; (2) defining and criticizing the modern world; and (3) suggesting new forms of individual and collective subjectivity commensurate with modern life. This course will explore these developments in-depth and examine Dada and Surrealist art in all its forms including painting, photomontage, collage, assemblage, performance, literature, and film.","Biro,Matthew Nicholas",HISTART,376,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

How does art manage to thrive under systems of oppression? How do we judge the aesthetic and activist aspects of a work of art? This course looks at how art has been used as a form of resistance against oppression and subjugation in the broadest sense: including governmental, societal, and domestic oppression. We will examine contemporary artists and works on a global scale including artist responses to the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., May ’68 in France, Palestinian resistance since 1948, international responses to recent wars in the Middle East and other global neo-colonial interventions, global feminist, queer rights, and disability movements, among others. Students will develop skills in visual analysis, critical thinking, and academic writing.

Looking at African Things,"In southeastern Nigeria, an Igbo proverb tells us, ""You can't view a performance standing in one place."" In the West, however, an understanding of African visual culture has long been centered on the practice of exhibiting African objects out of their vital contexts—rendering them motionless, making them available to our consuming vision, mapping out onto them our own systems of value. Such a practice has unfolded especially in museums dedicated to the exhibition of objects categorized as ""African Art."" But it is not these objects alone that are made to represent ""Africa"" so problematically; in world's fairs, theme parks, adventure tours, and other cultural expositions, living Africans too are transformed into things, into images of themselves. In this course, we will examine the history of how African objects have become ""African Art"": What are the terms by which African people describe the objects they create and use? What are the translations that allow us to consider those objects within the canons of Art History? What is excluded from those canons, and why? How are such strange and even violent transformations a metaphor for how African people have been transformed into objects? And what do African artists themselves have to say about it?","Doris,David T",HISTART,406,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,HISTART 208/AAS 208.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Made in Detroit: A History of Art and Culture in the Motor City,"The embodiment of ""Modern Times"" was the assembly line and Detroit, dubbed ""the capital of the Twentieth Century"" played an important symbolic role in the modern imagination. Yet while artists depicted Detroit's industry as an abstract emblem of twentieth-century progress— and later of dystopian decline— the city has complicated labor, racial, and political history that its art, architecture, and urban planning help us to question. This seminar examines how Detroit has been presented in art and the role that the arts and architecture have played in the city from the 1880s to the present. We will consider both works produced in Detroit that defined a technological future and urban culture for the world and those that have particular local histories, from the sleek factories that heralded modern architecture in America to the artificial past that Henry Ford assembled at Greenfield Village, from the heroic worker figures of Diego Rivera's murals to the controversies surrounding the Joe Louis monument and street art, from ""ruin porn"" and gentrification to prospects for the future. This year we will devote extra attention to researching Detroit arts during the rise of the Black Power movement, through the 1967 rebellion or riot and into the city's emergence as a majority-Black metropolis.","Zurier,Rebecca",HISTART,431,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"Upperclass standing; prior coursework in Art History, U.S. History, American Culture, or Urban studies, and permission of instructor.",,May not be repeated for credit.,

This course surveys the historical avant-gardes of the early twentieth century, presenting them as a rich interconnected network that encompassed East and West. Italian Futurism, German Dadaism, French Surrealism and their impact on East-European avant-gardes will be discussed in detail; in turn, the impact of Soviet Constructivism and Czech Surrealism will be examined. Special issues will include the role of language, new mass media, and technology. Other topics include the women artists of the avant-garde, manifesto as a genre, New Typography, and the avant-garde conception of the book.

Upper-Level Seminar,"Starting from the premise that race plays itself out visually, the course explores the relationship between art, materiality, space, and race. In addition to reading foundational literature in critical race studies including W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde, our inquiries will be grounded by five case studies: South Africa, Germany, India, Mexico, and the US. Each one of these cases will provide a conception of race rooted in local histories and cultures. By analyzing the visual and material dimensions of apartheid, antisemitism, xenophobia, slavery, and colonization through these case studies, we will articulate a multidimensional understanding of race as a historical concept. However, to ask how race has shaped visual culture also has global implications, as demonstrated by the recent removal of racists monuments across the world. Thus, by looking at each case study in comparison, students will develop an understanding of both the global and the local ramifications of racism and the antiracist movement. Objects, buildings, places, paintings, names, sculptures,s and public art will structure our weekly debates. Students will engage in visual analysis and independent research for their final assessment.","Rozas-Krause,Valentina Javiera",HISTART,497,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Visualizing Race Comparatively,3,,,Previous coursework in the History of Art.,,May be elected three times for credit.

This course will introduce students to a diverse group of Indigenous artists working in the Americas and elsewhere from 1960 to the present whose practices provide insight into the machine agencies that shape our shared world. Each class will focus on the history, theory and practice of different media technology, including photography, film, sound art, video and television art, and other telecommunications platforms. In addition to studying key episodes where the history of these media intersected with colonial projects or Indigenous resistance, we will analyze core theoretical positions on media studies from the fields of Indigenous futurisms, cybernetics, and the materialist discipline known as media archaeology. Along the way, we will consider such fundamental questions as: How and why do we differentiate tool from technology, a technology from the medium? What are the racialized, gendered or primitivizing implications of these distinctions? How has technologically-aided representation been weaponized against Indigenous sovereignty, and how might media become sympathetic allies? How have media’s material qualities allowed humans to expand our field of relations, and how do machines form relations through us?","Norman,David Winfield",HISTART,497,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Keepers of the Fire: Media Archaeology for Colonized Lands,3,,,Previous coursework in the History of Art.,,May be elected three times for credit.

What is History?,"You might think you know what history is: it’s what happened in the past — the names, dates, and events that fill textbooks. But think again. History is not about memorizing facts. It’s about asking questions about the past, finding clues, and using our imaginations to piece those clues together into stories — stories that shape our present and future. • Does this mean history is fiction? • Who gets to do history — whose stories should we accept as true? • How is history different in different parts of the world? • How do political struggles, in the U.S. and around the globe, shape the way people see the past and use it in their everyday lives? • Can history predict or improve the future, and if not, what is history for? • Must histories only be written in books? Or are there other sites that ""produce"" history? Put another way, where can we ""find"" history? This course will introduce you to various approaches to history, drawing examples from across the globe and throughout the centuries. But above all, it will teach you new ways of thinking critically and internationally about the world you live in — its past, present, and future. And it will help you prepare for any future courses or endeavors that require you to assess different kinds of evidence, grapple with conflicting interpretations about a topic, engage in critical inquiry and analysis, to craft an argument, and to develop empathy through historical or cultural understanding.

We will consider the uses of rule-of-law ideology in justifying colonial rule and in unraveling it, the negotiation of race and gender formations in the legal arena, and the circulation and transformation of legal concepts and institutions across empires. Given the intersectional nature of legal history scholarship, this course is as much a history of social life under colonialism as it is a global intellectual history of the political in the age of empire.

The Writing of History,"This writing-intensive course introduces first-year students to the fundamentals of composition and argumentation through a thematic focus on the entangled histories of Russia and the United States. We will cover every stage of the writing process, from outlining to drafting to revision to submission. Students will have opportunities to work with peers and the instructor on defining and achieving their writing goals. Although this course emphasizes writing about history, the skills and strategies developed here will be applicable across a variety of academic and non-academic contexts.

Although Russia and the United States are often presented as polar opposites with incompatible values (collectivism vs. individualism, authoritarianism vs. democracy, cynicism vs. optimism), the two nations have in many ways followed parallel historical trajectories. Both were frontier empires on the periphery of Europe that maintained systems of legal bondage well into the nineteenth century. Both fought against Nazi Germany and emerged from World War II as nuclear-armed superpowers with global ambitions. Moreover, both share a long history of reciprocal fascination and paranoia, a combination evident once again in the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This course explores the social, cultural, economic, and geopolitical forces that have shaped encounters between Russians and Americans over the past century and a half. When and where did our mutual (mis)understandings first arise? How and why did we become the “frenemies” that we are today? In search of answers to these questions, we will go beyond the framework of international relations to examine the meanings of historical events for the ordinary people who experienced them.Course Requirements:","McConnell,Alexander",HISTORY,195,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Frenemies: The Russian/American Encounter, 1850s to Present",4,FYWR,,,This course may not be included in a History major.

The Writing of History,"In the light of the recent political events, it is easy to overlook the fact that alongside the many differences between the United States and Russia, there are about as many similarities. In the last several hundred years, the two nations expanded to the vast spaces of their respective continents; both went through rapid and at times painful industrialization and became the two great superpowers of the world, each representing one of the two major ideologies of the 20th century: Capitalism and Communism. Moreover, part of what is now the United States was first colonized by the Russian empire. The two wings of Europe, as Martin Heidegger once called Russia and America, were allies in the two world wars, only later to become deadly foes contending for the hegemony over the rest of the world. What leads to this rivalry, and was it inevitable? In this class, we will look at the development of Russian-American relations throughout the centuries and will see how these two not-quite European countries built themselves in constant, yet somewhat complicated, dialogue. 

This class is not intended to be a thorough exploration of formal international relations (although, of course, we will touch on this topic) but rather will focus on the cultural history of the contacts and likenesses between the two nations. We will try to see how both Russia and the US helped one another to define the very foundations of their respective national self-understanding and how it lead to them becoming foes during the Cold War. Starting from the early contacts between the countries in the late 18th - 19th centuries, we will move on to the early Soviet era when those contacts intensified and the stakes raised rose as the two countries started to represent the two rival ideologies.

First Year Seminar in Social Sciences,"This first-year seminar is about the history and politics of journalism in Africa. Print technology arrived in Africa in the mid-19th century as part of the apparatus of colonial rule. African intellectuals quickly recognized print technology as a useful means of addressing new audiences. In the 1930s and 40s, African nationalists used newspapers to define and defend the cultural norms that drew them together as a people. In the 1950s urban populists found in newspapers a vehicle by which to mobilize campaigns. In the 1960s and 70s, after independence, African governments sought to close down avenues of free speech. But newspapermen kept publishing, and in the 1990s newspapers were the forums where a new generation of democratic politics could be conceived. Each week we will focus on a different newspaper. We'll discuss the newspaper that Mahatma Gandhi published in South Africa during the 1920s. We'll talk about the 'Voice of Uganda', which was an instrument for Idi Amin's dictatorship. We’ll study the politics of Drum, a news magazine that made African cities look posh, modern, and romantic. Nowhere was the ‘news’ simply available, ready to be reported. African editors made choices about what was newsworthy, and by their news-making work, they encouraged their readers to see themselves as sharers of particular experiences. Our interest here is in how newsmen used to print to create news, address the public, organize people, and open up paths of political action. At the end of the semester, students will prepare a research paper about the biography of an African newspaper.","Peterson,Derek R",HISTORY,196,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Making News in Africa,3,SS,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,

We will think about how to make historical arguments and how to use written sources as evidence.  In gesturing toward the history of capitalism between 1600 and 1800, We will look at such unfamiliar issues as the fear of ""paper money."" We will tease out both changing attitudes towards trade, commerce, usury and social structure and we will also consider geopolitical exploitation – that is colonialism and slavery.","Hawes,Clement C",HISTORY,197,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Literature and Capitalism,3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,

Ancient Greece,"In History 200, we investigate ancient Greek history from the Bronze Age until the advent of Roman domination (ca. 1500 to 146 BCE). This is a course in which we follow the lead of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, and inquire into the past (historian in Greek originally meant inquiry!) We use ancient evidence to look into a range of issues that emerge in the course of early Greek history: the nature of interactions between Greeks and other ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, Near East, and North Africa; political developments in Greek city-states (especially Athens and Sparta); the tensions between local identities and common Greek identity; gender and sexuality, freedom and slavery in Greek politics and society. We do all this while holding up modern interpretations of the ancient Greek past and its legacy to critical re-examination, with the aim of better equipping ourselves to evaluate claims about ancient civilizations and what the ancient Greeks might mean for us now. Readings include ancient texts in translation and modern scholarship. The course consists of lectures and sections in which students make critical use of sources to discuss and debate historical questions. The final grade is based on two tests, two writing assignments, and participation in discussions and lectures. Everyone is welcome.

Doing History,"The course provides a structured and cohesive foundation in the analytical, methodological, compositional, and historiographical skills involved in “doing history.” Students will encounter a diverse set of primary sources in order to evaluate how historians identify and interpret the clues, evidence, and omissions in the historical record. Students also will read secondary historical texts on selected subjects, with a focus on historiographical debates over competing interpretations of the past and consideration of the various approaches of political, social, cultural, and other subfields of history. In addition to the critical analysis of primary and secondary sources, HISTORY 202 focuses on the practice of historical writing and the development of research skills, preparing students for the requirements of more advanced history courses, especially the capstone Junior/Senior Colloquium.

East Asia: Early Transformations,"Today, China, Korea, and Japan are known for their powerful economies, their technological achievements, and their contributions to global popular culture. Diplomatic relations between the East Asian countries are tense, due to ideological differences, border disputes, pollution, epidemics, and the memory of Japanese colonial aggression. But what was the relationship between the East Asian continent, the Korean peninsula, and the Japanese archipelago before modern times, before East Asia was divided into races and nations? This course follows kings and emperors, conquerors and diplomats, monks and merchants as they establish polities, expand boundaries, spread religions and philosophical ideas, and exchange goods in a changing cultural landscape, from ca. 1600 BCE to ca. 1800 CE.","de Pee,Christian",HISTORY,204,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

We will investigate some of the events, people, cultures, trends, and controversies that have made the region one of the most important and exciting in the world. Our canvas will be broad: from exploring one of the earliest urban civilizations, to engaging contemporary debates in the region over ecological sustainability, caste conflict, and the gendered dimensions of daily life. Our sources will include ancient treatises, contemporary scholarship, film, fiction, and award-winning journalism. The course will emphasize critical historical skills, including reading for key ideas, asking historical questions, drawing connections between different times and places, evaluating the reliability of sources, constructing sound arguments, assessing change over time, and determining the limits of what can be known about the past. And we will try to have some fun.","Glover,William J",HISTORY,206,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - From Mohenjodaro to Modi,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Southeast Asian Civilization,"Southeast Asia is one of the world's most culturally diverse regions, home to Buddhist, Muslim, Confucian, and Christian civilizations. It boasts ancient monuments of surpassing beauty, grandeur, and symbolic complexity. It was the scene of the bloodiest conflict since 1945, the Vietnam War. Today it has one of the world's fastest growing regional economies.  Moreover, Southeast Asian political history reflects patterns characteristic of much of Asia, Africa, and the Mideast, and thus offers insights into Global development in general. This course offers an introduction to Southeast Asian history from the earliest civilizations, through the colonial conquest, to the contemporary political and economic scene. It assumes no prior knowledge of the region whatsoever.","Lieberman,Victor B",HISTORY,207,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Early Medieval Europe, 300-1000","Barbarian invasions! Mass conversions to monotheistic religions like Islam and Christianity! The fall of Rome! Ascetical drop-outs who criticize mainstream society from its margins! New gender roles! The dissemination of radically new technologies! People adopting more sustainable economic patterns! And of course fascinating new ways of defining otherness… All of these themes are integral to the history of early medieval Europe and receive due attention in Hist./Mems 210. In “Early Medieval Europe” we cover the social, economic, and cultural history of Europe and the Mediterranean from around AD 300 to 1000, pretty much the most exciting centuries in the historical record, and certainly the ones when the contemporary order of things (nation-states, universal religions, integrated for-profit economies) first came into being in western Eurasia.","Squatriti,Paolo",HISTORY,210,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,
The Philippines:  Culture and History,"This course is an introduction to the historical formation and cultural complexity of the Philippines.  It surveys major periods in Philippine history, paying particular attention to their cultural dimensions.  Starting with the inclusion of the archipelago in Asian maritime trade, to becoming a colony of Spain, to the nationalist revolution, through the American colonial period, and arriving at the post-colonial present, we will draw from primary source materials, historiography, ethnography, literary works, and popular culture to examine the cultural effects of processes and events such as religious conversion and colonial encounter; revolution and nationalism; U.S. Imperialism; regional, class, and identity formation; modernity, globalization, and migration.   Of continued reflection throughout the course will be the recurring problems and challenges of trying to study a place and people comprised of such incredible diversity in historical experience and cultural life.","de la Cruz,Deirdre Leong",HISTORY,219,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Environment and History in Preindustrial Europe,"How did pre-industrial societies fit into the various ecological systems of western Eurasia? How different were the adaptations of people in Scandinavia, Normandy, or Andalusia to the climate, landscape, other animals, and vegetation of their regions? What ecological forces made some communities collapse and others thrive? Did nature determine what humans could do, and what they actually did? What impact did pre-industrial human activity have on the European environment? These are some of the main questions Hist. 236 asks. The course focuses on the ancient, medieval, and early modern periods (roughly 300 BC to AD 1800), and ranges widely across the vast and diverse landmass of “Europe” (with some detours into the relevant sea masses, too). While offering a long view of environmental change, it shows that before the Industrial Revolution, just as in later industrialized societies, European people were entangled in nature and that their history was shaped by ecological relationships. As contemporary societies uncertainly navigate environmental change, it becomes more important to understand how past societies coped with their own mutable environments. Hist./ Environ. 236 advances that understanding. Hist./ Environ. 236 meets twice per week, mixing discussion with lectures. A mid-term test, a take-home final exam, and two 5-page essays are required.

The World Before 1492,"Long before European “voyages of discovery” ushered in the modern era of globalism and global inequality, huge areas of the world had already been connected and divided by extensive systems of material exchange, cross-cultural interaction, and political integration. The history of these earlier worlds is the subject of this course. The pursuit of comparisons and connections will be the passport that allows us to criss-cross the regions, societies, and cultures into which the world’s pre-modern history is usually divided. By practicing history on a large scale, particular questions and problems come to the fore: Why did major social and technological transformations such as agriculture or writing arise multiple times in different areas and periods and then spread further afield? Were their causes and consequences always the same? How did human groups in various regions form states, empires, and other collectives? How did cross-cultural interaction ebb and flow with changing patterns of migration, trade, and imperialism or with the rise of universal religions? What effects did broad climatic and ecological changes have on different societies and systems of interaction? How were larger world-historical trends experienced, advanced or resisted at more local levels? How did people placed at the margins of such trends, such as nomads and subject populations, come to play important roles in large-scale transformations? The class format consists of lectures and discussion sections. In order to understand world history in terms of both large-scale patterns and human actors, we shall tackle big questions by examining very particular pieces of – mostly textual – evidence from the pre-modern past.","Cipa,Hakki Erdem",HISTORY,239,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
The World Since 1492,"What is globalization and when did it begin? How did different parts of the world become deeply connected? Why are some places rich and others poor? We will address these questions, and more, in this introductory survey of the modern world from c. 1450 to the present. This course is an introductory survey of the modern world from c. 1450 to the present. The course will focus on the development of what has been called the ‘modern world system.’ The modern world-system developed with the advent of capitalism and brought in its wake significant changes for different regions of the world. The manner in which different regions were integrated into this new world-system had far-reaching consequences for their internal development and for their relations with the rest of the world. Our aim will be to examine the process by which the modern world-system integrated different regions during the historical stages of its development. We will examine the development of the modern world-system through the following stages: -the first stage of merchant capitalism, c. 1450 -c1750 -the second stage of industrial capitalism, c. 1750 -c. 1870 -the third stage of monopoly capitalism, c 1870 -c.1914 -the fourth stage of defensive monopoly capitalism, 1914 -1945 -the fifth stage of reformed capitalism, 1945 -c. 1989 -the sixth stage of global capitalism, c. 1989 –2008 -the seventh stage of late or crisis capitalism, c 2008-to the present With each stage, we will identify the defining characteristics of capitalism at that stage, and explore its implications for the internal and external development of different regions of the world.","Sinha,Mrinalini",HISTORY,240,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,Meets pre-1800 and transregional requirements in History.,May not be repeated for credit.,

It is also a difficult history to access as most African civilizations before the 19th century prioritized unwritten forms of communication. This class presents several important episodes in the long history of early African civilization and introduces students to the ways historians of the distant past think about and use various forms of evidence including language, material culture, oral traditions, and folklore.","Poteet,Ellen Spence",HISTORY,246,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Introduction to Chinese Civilization,"This course is intended to introduce students to major issues in Chinese history from ancient times to the Chinese Revolution of 1949, with a specific focus on issues relating to race and ethnicity. In this connection, we investigate three problems:

China is often seen as a racially, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous society, but what is China and (Han) Chinese?
To what extent was the direction of Chinese civilization driven by contact with ethnic, religious, and cultural others? What role did ethnic, religious, and cultural conflict play in producing Chinese identity?
How did China transition from a multi-ethnic empire to a modern nation-state? To what extent was the creation of modern China a product of racial and ethnic strife?

 Readings and lectures will give equal weight to political and social developments, as well as to intellectual, religious, and cultural forces. There are no books or coursepacks for this course; all readings will be available through Canvas.Course Requirements:Course assignments will not only include reading primary and secondary literature (entirely in English), but also require students to analyze visual sources.

Twentieth-Century American Wars as Social and Personal Experience,"This course will examine the American experience of war in this century. Lectures, readings, films, and discussions will focus not only on the military experience itself, but on how America's wars, real  and imagined; have shaped the country's economy, politics, and culture. The course will also examine the processes of transmission and memory: how Americans who did not fight learned about  those who did, and what all Americans have remembered or have been taught to remember about  the wars of this century. Finally, we will consider how the nation's wartime conduct, at home and on  the battlefield, has fit into long-standing social patterns and behavior such as our alleged propensity  for violence. In brief, we will be looking at the American experience of war as inclusively as a term will allow.","Marwil,Jonathan L",HISTORY,266,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Explorations in History,"This course will introduce students to the practice of public history—how history is put to work in the world. We’ll consider museum exhibits, walking tours, historic houses, monuments, oral history, crowdsourcing, podcasting, robotic presidents, and more. We’ll learn how public historians work with a variety of audiences to present difficult or contested pasts, like the 1967 Detroit uprising or antebellum plantation homes. We’ll consider how public history can be used to subvert or reinforce colonialism and empire—and how it can be used to promote social justice. 

What, if anything, is compromised and lost in this process? How do factors like design, venue, and writing style affect how history is consumed? How can historians share authority and develop true collaborations with communities?

Using case studies, we will grapple with these issues as a group. Students will walk away with a basic understanding of public history and knowledge of what direction they might take if they wish to pursue a career in the field.Course Requirements:When meeting in person, this course will convene weekly for a two-hour session, including a short lecture, discussion, and collaborative work/student presentations. When presented online, the course will convene for a shorter synchronous session focusing on discussion and collaborative work/student presentations.

Women in the Ancient Mediterranean,"


Women make up half the population, and yet we have little evidence of their experiences in their own words for most of human history. This course engages creatively and deeply with the limits of historical knowledge by exploring the lives of women in antiquity. Focusing on the multicultural world of the Roman empire, we will examine the roles of women in the political, domestic, and religious spheres, as well as how women were implicated in major cultural transformations, such as the rise of Christianity. Through sources that include literary texts, medical treatises, material culture, and works of art, students will learn to read against the grain in order to explore the opportunities and obstacles that women faced long ago – and, in certain ways, still, face today.","Freidin,Anna Bonnell",HISTORY,303,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
American Addictions,"

Addiction is national news. From the opioid epidemic to overusing smartphones, addiction is at the center of both public and private life today. Each of us has been touched by it—personally, among family and friends, or as part of a wide-ranging conversation made up of scientific studies, intimate confessions, policy debates, and popular media. This course explores these dimensions of addiction in both the past and the present, using history to illuminate current research and the current crisis. Each week, we explore a different substance or behavior from historical and present perspectives, working our way from early anxieties about alcohol abuse or problematic gambling in the nineteenth century to the latest research by social psychologists, neuroscientists, and public health experts. Part of the class is collaborative (students work in teams to write op-eds about crucial issues), while part of it focuses on individual research papers that will address an addiction of the student’s choosing.","Cowles,Henry",HISTORY,305,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

After Alexander: The Hellenistic Age in the Mediterranean and the Near East,"The campaigns of Alexander the Great and the struggles that followed his death in Babylon in 323 BCE transformed the political, economic, and cultural conditions of all the lands surrounding the eastern Mediterranean. The old cities of Classical Greece – and new centers like Alexandria – became part of a world dominated by the competing kingdoms of Alexander’s successors. Two of these major Greek-Macedonian empires ruled as foreigners over the non-Greek cultures of the Near East and Egypt. In a modern world still coming to grips with imperial legacies and globalization, this fascinating period of ancient history has become an object of renewed interest and scholarly attention. Using primary sources in translation as well as works of modern scholarship, students in this course will explore the Hellenistic world from Alexander until the death of Cleopatra in 30 BCE. Topics to be addressed will include: political changes and continuities, cultural and intellectual developments (religion, literature, philosophy, and science), and the problems of sources and evidence; particular attention will be devoted to the nature and consequences of interactions between different cultural and ethnic groups in the Hellenistic period.","Moyer,Ian S",HISTORY,309,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,HISTORY 200 or 201.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Atlantic Slavery and the Making of the Modern World,"This upper-level seminar will examine systems of unfree labor in Africa and the Americas during the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade. Beginning with European colonization of the Americas and ending with the emancipations of the nineteenth century, the course will explore the labor and cultural practices of enslaved people as well as the evolution of slavery as a legal and economic institution. Although slavery was a global institution, we will pay special attention to the way that the organization of labor and the heritage of slavers and slaves created different societies in different parts of the Americas. We will also consider longstanding debates in the history of slavery such as the origins of racial slavery and forms of slave resistance. And throughout the course we will always consider the legacy of Atlantic slavery and how it continues to unfold in the problems and promises of our world today.","Spooner,Matthew Patrick",HISTORY,310,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
History of European Integration,"The construction of the European Union has been one of the most exciting and controversial political experiments of the post-WWII world. This course aims to introduce students from a variety of humanistic and social scientific backgrounds to the study of European integration and trans-national identity formation, viewed as contested and contingent historical processes. We will examine the visions that informed the institutional work of Europe’s “founding fathers,” but we will also focus on the often-contentious debates which, almost from the beginning, surrounded the practices and meanings of political and economic governance, citizenship, and cultural identity. Thus, we will set Brexit and the rise of populism in their historical contexts. 

Topics will include not only a historical overview of the institutional innovations that have led from post-WWII reconstruction to the adoption of a single currency (the Euro) in 2002 and the current financial crisis, but also a discussion of how Europeans have encouraged and resisted integrative processes at the levels of technological change, popular culture, and social movements. Particular attention will also be devoted to the evolving relationships between western Europe and the rest of the world, especially eastern Europe, the US, and the post-colonial countries.","Gaggio,Dario",HISTORY,312,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
"Europe in the Era of Total War, 1870-1945","


In 1945, Europe was in ruins. Two global conflicts between 1914-1918 and 1939-1945 had leveled entire cities with the destructive powers of industrialized warfare. These conflicts produced genocidal regimes that pursued mass murder at a previously unimaginable scale. What made such violence possible, and how did ordinary men and women experience it? History 318 will seek answers to these questions by beginning with an account of Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. We will explore the social dislocation that accompanied Europe’s transformation from a predominantly rural and agrarian society into a modern industrial economy and consumer society. You will read about the ideologies and cultural forces that helped people understand—and misunderstand—these often bewildering developments: liberalism, socialism, and nationalism. We will follow the events that took Europe from the devastation of World War I to the postwar revolutions that reshaped political and economic life in Russia. The final weeks of the class will explore the rise of fascism and Nazism in Europe, and the prolonged nightmare of the Second World War.","Wroblewski, Kathleen  ",HISTORY,318,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

The course will spend considerable time on the First World War and the processes through which the war experience of mass participation and trauma were understood, as well as the ways in which the war is currently being remembered or commemorated 100 years later; and it will also consistently engage with the relation between the history of “Britain” and the British empire, including during and after the war, and during the era of rising fascism.Intended Audience:No previous knowledge of British history is assumed or required and students from all majors are welcome","Israel,Kali A K",HISTORY,320,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Era of World War I,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Humanities Topics in History,"The 18th-century Scottish moral philosopher Adam Smith claimed that the true wealth of the nation lay in its culture.  More recent writers have argued that contemporary Scottish politics, including questions about independence, have often been infused with or even driven by cultural activism, and that reading, seeing, hearing, and participating in cultural activity have been ways in which Scottish people think about and act on political issues.
 
In this course, we will explore Scottish cultural activity from the late 19th century to the present—including imagined futures-- through literature of many kinds, visual arts of many kinds, performances of many kinds, music of many kinds, and more.  The material of the course will include drama, film, fiction, poetry, music, landscape works, creative engagements with science and technology, and the visual arts. Students will examine Scottish history through how it has been used and transformed both in canonical works and new, ongoing work.  
 
Cliches and stereotypes of Scotland are easy to describe and to dismiss as inadequate. But we will explore Scottish cultural history not in order to debunk some claims about “Scottishness” or “national identity” and replace them with other claims we like better but to consider how Scottish cultural history itself complicates, multiplies, or refuses such claim-making.Course Requirements:Intended Audience:Students from all majors are welcome and no previous knowledge is assumed.","Israel,Kali A K",HISTORY,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Modern Scottish Culture,3,HU,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  ,
Humanities Topics in History,"This course will introduce students to historical narratives that center on same-gender intimacies and gender non-conformity in African Diasporic communities. Students will survey the growing body of interdisciplinary scholarship on such topics and interrogate how black queer cultural workers craft(ed) historical narratives (via films, poems, plays, and fiction) to (re)imagine pasts and possible futures.","Jones, Jennifer Dominique",HISTORY,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Black Queer Histories,3,HU,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  ,
Humanities Topics in History,"What does it mean to be “black” in Jewish culture? In this course, we explore how Jewish societies have understood and engaged with Blackness and Black peoples over the ages. Delving into the parallel struggles of Blacks and Jews, we ask: How does the history of slavery intersect with the status of Jews in the Middle East? What connections can be drawn between the civil rights struggles in Israel and America? Throughout the course, we discuss the flexible and interrelated nature of the categories of Blackness and Jewishness across different historical, geographical, and temporal contexts. Themes explored include black and Jewish anti-colonial thought; Ethiopian and North African Jewish history; race and racism within the Middle East. By the end of the course, students will better understand how diasporic and racial identities are constructed and reconstructed over time and space.","Roby,Bryan Karle",HISTORY,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Blackness and Jewishness: A History of Encounters,3,HU,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  ,
Humanities Topics in History,"The 20th century saw the rise of African independence movements calling for an end to colonial rule and the rights of self-determination. There was not, however, consensus on what independence meant beyond political sovereignty. Certain parties, organizations, and individuals linked independence with revolution, a social and economic revolution within African society itself, that went beyond aspirations to national independence. The revolutions as fully envisioned did not happen. Some were begun, even before independence, but—undermined whether from without or from within—were left uncompleted or diverted into channels that ran counter to original revolutionary aims. This course will explore what the revolutionary hopes and actions of specific leaders and movements were, who “the people” were, and what was indeed achieved. Where the revolutions were betrayed, we will consider both what brought about such betrayals and what endured of the spirit of hope in a new order and of a refusal to accept a status quo that silenced the call to People’s Power.","Poteet,Ellen Spence",HISTORY,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 005, - People's Power!: Revolution in 20th Century Africa,3,HU,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.
Humanities Topics in History,"“How do humans live in and cope with time?“ is the question this class pursues. Temporalities have profoundly shaped human societies in the past and continue to do so now. Our excursions will shed light on political, social, cultural, religious, and personal scripts in measuring, organizing, and experiencing time. The times of prayer and play, of work and exploitation, of industry and leisure, of the environment and environmental disasters as well as the notion of historical time itself are among the topics. The overall goal is to increase our awareness of time as a dimension of our lives.","Puff,Helmut",HISTORY,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 006," - The History, Politics, and Ethics of Time",3,HU,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  ,
Humanities Topics in History,"What is love? What does it mean to be a true friend? What bonds of commitment and loyalty should exist in relationships? And why does it matter? This course uses selected case studies from antiquity to the present to explore the different ways that people in China, Japan, and Korea answered these questions over time. We’ll see how people thought about and expressed love, loyalty, and friendship in a wide range of historical materials, including poems and stories, letters and memoirs, eulogies and inscriptions, and medical treatises and philosophical texts. We’ll learn that emotions have a history, and we’ll also see how changing historical forces created new ways of understanding and expressing these fundamental human impulses. Class requirements include attendance and participation in-class activities, response essays and document annotation exercises, and a final creative or research project. This course satisfies the humanities distribution requirement and the pre-1800 requirement for the history major.","Wu,Yi-Li",HISTORY,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 007," - Love, Loyalty, and Friendship in East Asian History",3,HU,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.

"Russia and the Soviet Union: Reform, Revolution, and the Socialist Experiment","From the earliest times, the polities of the East Slavs, and, later, Russia attempted to find a way in a competitive international environment despite disadvantages and challenges. Even as the largest country in the world (by territory), the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union were confronted by rival states that threatened -- and felt threatened by -- the colossus that stretched from central Europe to the Pacific Ocean.","Makin,Michael",HISTORY,332,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Russia and the Soviet Union: Reform, Revolution, and the Socialist Experiment",4,SS,,,May not be counted in a Slavic Department academic minor.

History and Theory of Punishment,"Ever been curious about the history of crime, punishment and prisons in the United States?  What is crime? How is it counted? Why does it fluctuate? Are there important distinctions between crimes? Which is more effective, punishment or rehabilitation? How far should either go? Who should administer either? How has the administration of law and order, corrections, sentencing, parole, etc. changed over time? Does region matter? Does race, gender and/or class matter? And how is this system actually experienced by those on the inside?
Through primary and secondary source readings, as well as documentary film, this course will look closely at the history and theory of punishment, and at how prisons and detention have been used to address social ills over time in American history. It will pay close attention to the importance of historical context and political moment when considering how the judicial system as well as prison system operates, and it will assess the ways in which race, gender, class, and sexuality shape both prison politics and populations. The course will explore the importance of regional difference vis-à-vis the administration of punishment, and will also grapple with some of the questions that Americans find most troubling today with regard to crime and punishment. These include: debates over the death penalty, the law regarding youth offenders, the ethics of drug laws, prisoner civil liberties vs. victims’ rights, mandatory sentencing guidelines, and how the criminal justice system deals with the mentally ill. Finally, students will address the question of how the United States might best remedy the criminal justice problems it now faces—both in theory and in practice.","Thompson, Heather Ann",HISTORY,345,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
History of American Radicalism,"This course offers a general history of radical, left-wing movements in the United States that were intended to challenge varied forms of inequality, domination, exploitation, or violence and to foster some kind of emancipatory reconstruction of American life and government. With some attention to early forms of artisans´ and workingmen´s radicalism, as well as the antebellum abolitionist and women´s rights movement, we will focus on the development and the fate of a modern Left — from the labor, anarchist, socialist, and communist movements through the Black freedom struggle and the New Left of the 1960s, feminism, gay liberation, union democracy movements and beyond. We will try to understand the aspirations and ideas, forms of organization and activism, dilemmas and weaknesses, relations to mainstream politics and repressive authority, successes and failures in each of these cases. 
	
The course will conclude with a study of radicalism in the late 20th century and early 21st century: women´s, environmentalist, antiwar, and queer activism of the 1980s; the organization of street protests in response to ""globalization,"" signaled dramatically in the “Battle of Seattle” of late 1999; and the advent of “Occupy Wall Street” in the global “year of the protester,” 2011.  We conclude with a discussion of debates from 2012 to the present over social inequality in the United States, including popular protest against police violence and mass incarceration.Course Requirements:No data submittedIntended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:No data submitted","Brick,Howard",HISTORY,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Latin America: The Colonial Period,"

This course introduces the early period of Latin American history. We begin by exploring Amerindian civilizations on the eve of European arrival in the Americas, before turning to the Iberian Peninsula in the years leading up and through Spanish and Portuguese expansion. We study interactions among Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans, and the emergence of multi-ethnic societies, political and religious cultures in what might most accurately be called a New World for all. Primary sources – both texts and images – are our principal points of entry for understanding colonial systems, work regimes, tensions and conflicts, and evolving identities within “colonial Latin America.” Our focus extends into late eighteenth-century when a variety of struggles and rebellions across the region anticipated independence movements in the early nineteenth century.

Sex and Sexuality in U.S. Popular Culture,"We will explore how changing ideas about sex, sexuality, and gender appeared in certain types of twentieth-century popular culture. As a group, we will learn to interpret media, such as movies or television, as historical texts that provide insight into past notions about sex in the United States. To this end, we will start with the assumption that media functions as mechanisms of socialization and as a venue for expressing popular concerns or beliefs about gender roles, same-sex desire, race, and so forth. We will uncover how the media represented historical issues such as courtship among heterosexuals, pornography, gay liberation, and birth control through a weekly film lab. At the same time, we will seek to uncover the voices of groups that the mainstream media have often omitted (or actively sought to silence) in discussions about sex. To that end, much of our course reading will draw from academics engaged in an assortment of overlapping fields. Students will be introduced to scholarship in race and ethnic studies, queer studies, feminist studies, and so forth.
Students should be aware that certain course materials contain sexually explicit language and/or images. Some images include nudity and/or sexually graphic content.Course Requirements:Short response papers, class participation, viewing films, a mid-term paper, and a final project.

"War, Rebellion and Revolution in China Through Two Centuries","This course will explore how China was transformed through war, rebellion, and revolution, from the White Lotus Rebellion in the late 18th century through the last decades of the 20th century. Although the subject matter will be arranged chronologically, different time periods and epochs will be used to highlight different themes in Chinese revolutionary and military history. The course will draw on selected readings from secondary sources, as well as fiction and translated primary sources. The course should enable students to identify and explain the significance and relevance of major figures, terms, events, and institutions in Chinese political, military, and social history from 1790 to 2000 by using supporting evidence from course readings. Students will acquire a nuanced and critical understanding of how the transformation in China in the 19th and 20th centuries has been characterized by both continuity and rupture.

September 11,"


September 11 was unquestionably a unique day in America's history, and uniquely unsettling in its effect.  Extraordinary events have always inspired contemporaries to inquire into their causes, their consequences, and their meanings.  September 11 offers an unusual opportunity for doing so given that it occurred in a time (and in places with so many means for knowing and recording it.
This course will examine the day's events from many vantage points, including why it happened — a subject yet to get serious public airing.  We will then look at the ways the nation and its leaders chose to interpret the attacks, respond to them politically and militarily, and subsequently respond to its vicitms, living as well as dead.  We will also examine how the nation's political and legal values have been affected, and how its writers and artists have chosen to deal with the event and it consequences.  Finally, we will deal with the ongoing process of memorializing September 11, and what our efforts at remembering tell us about who we are as a people.
This is a demanding course and the reading will be considerable, and will include at least six books, beginning with the Report of the 9/11 Commission, and a substantial course-pack.  We shall also look at several feature and documentary films.Course Requirements:In addition to a midterm and a final exam, there will also be a 10-15 page research paper.Intended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:No data submitted","Marwil,Jonathan L",HISTORY,360,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Literature in African History,"This course is about the history of African literature. The reading list includes some of the founding works in the field. It also includes lesser-known texts: novels published serially in West African newspapers; editorial writings from early Christian converts; a play from a beleaguered Ugandan author. We’ll be studying how African writers, in their creative work, participated in the political and moral arguments of their time. Literature was not an escape from real life. African writers did work in their texts: they conjured up audiences, fired them with a shared vision of the past and the future, and set them on a forward path together. By studying the social and political work that African writers did, this course explores the intersection of literature and history, and of imagination and politics. The course is organized around three national literatures: the literatures of Nigeria, of Kenya, and of South Africa. In each of the case studies we’ll be tracing the historical development of a particular literary tradition, studying how authors commented on the changing politics of their homelands. We’ll also be exploring a set of cross-cutting themes that draw the three case studies together. Some of these texts define and defend a national community. Other texts depict the crisis of urban life in twentieth century Africa. In the whole of our work together we’ll be asking a set of questions about the vocation of the literary writer. What were these authors doing in their own time? What was literature good for?","Peterson,Derek R",HISTORY,362,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Crime and Drugs in Modern America,"This course explores the various government wars on crime and drugs in the United States during the twentieth century, from alcohol prohibition through the crack cocaine and opioid “epidemics,” from anti-vice crusades in the Progressive Era through the recent rise of mass incarceration under what critics label the American prison-industrial complex. The U.S. currently incarcerates around 2.3 million people, a higher percentage of its citizens than any other nation in the world; counting probation and parole, on any given day more than 7 million Americans live under the supervision of the criminal justice system. At least 24 million Americans violate drug prohibition laws monthly, primarily by smoking marijuana or the illicit use of pharmaceuticals; of the half-million people imprisoned for nonviolent drug offenses, two-thirds are African American or Latino. This course will examine the deep historical roots of this contemporary landscape, especially the fuzzy and shifting boundaries between legality and illegality and the ways in which race, class, gender, and urban/suburban space have shaped policing practices, criminal justice enforcement, and media representations of criminality.

Topics range from Mafia syndicates and Mexican cartels to the FBI and Big Pharma, from “stop and frisk” policing to the “just say no” campaign against teenage drugs and alcohol, from immigration controls to the criminalization of political dissent, from crusades against juvenile delinquency to panics over kidnappers and sex offenders, from Attica and the prisoners’ rights movement to racial controversies such as the Rockefeller Drug Laws, Central Park Five, and Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson.
This is an active learning course with minimal lecturing that revolves around in-class discussion of readings and films, in-depth analysis of historical documents and digital archives, small-group collaborative research projects and presentations, field trips to campus archives, and a policy report in the form of a multimedia digital exhibit for the final project.","Lassiter,Matthew D",HISTORY,366,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
"Sex and Gender in U.S. History, 1600-2015","Beginning in seventeenth-century British America, this course will focus upon the experiences of American women--black and white, native and settler--from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. We will explore the family structure, gender expectations, and cultural practices. We will look closely at intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and class and the role they play in the development of self-identity.  The changing concepts of equality and difference, as employed by women and men in articulating gender relations, will serve as a theoretical framework for our examination.","Kelley,Mary C",HISTORY,371,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,W.,May not be repeated for credit.,
History of the U.S. West,"
 

Ecological zones as distinct as the Great Plains, Southwestern deserts, and the Pacific coast all fall into the region known today as the U.S. West. We might ask, how could it be that such divergent places would come to be conceived as a unified region? How, too, has the “West” come to hold such a critical place in the imagining of the United States' past and present? We might start to answer those questions by acknowledging that naming the region as the “West” has been only the most recent effort to understand these lands. Diverse populations, empires, and nations have at various moments thought of those same places as their “South”, their “North”, or their “East.” Whatever they called it, all of them thought of it as theirs. We will think through these shifting claims by considering diverse perspectives including Native Americans, Europeans, Latina/os, Asians, and Euro Americans as they appeared from 1200 CE to the present. Through that expansive span of time, we will learn, these plains, deserts, and mountains witnessed remarkable cross-cultural exchanges, celebrations, and great sorrows.","Mora,Anthony P",HISTORY,373,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"The Politics and Culture of the ""Sixties""","Civil Rights, Vietnam, Women’s Rights, Black Power, Brown Power, and campus activism. Rock ‘n’ Roll, Motown, The Graduate, Woodstock, and Hippies.  The 1960s staged some of the most transformative political and cultural developments in American history. This course examines the 1960s as a series of cultural and political battles in which various groups fought over what it means to be an American. We’ll consider the political battles that were waged from the early days of the civil rights movement to the activism on college campuses to the resignation of Richard Nixon.  We’ll also consider the cultural battles from the youth culture and Black culture origins of rock ‘n’ roll to the impact of musicians such as Nina Simone and the Beatles to the emergence of a counterculture. Along the way, with a focus on race, ethnicity, and gender, we will pay close attention to those who mobilized for social, political, and cultural change and to those who mobilized in defense of the status quo.

The Holocaust,"
The Holocaust — the persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945 — was one of the most horrific events in the history of the world. The atrocities committed in the heart of the twentieth-century threw into question the very notion of human progress, and continue to haunt humanity to this day. We have all seen images and films about the Holocaust, or have read literature and diaries from the time, but mostly we shy away from confronting the bigger questions that the Holocaust forces us to ask about ourselves and our history. This course will better equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to interpret representations of the Holocaust by grounding students with the factual basis on which these representations are made.  Students will learn to interpret some of the most important historical facts about the Holocaust, to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of contending explanations regarding the causes and effects of the Holocaust, and to contextualize the Holocaust.Course Requirements:Students will be evaluated on the basis of quizzes, writing assignments, and exams.Intended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:The course will be structured as a lecture with discussions.","Mays,Devi Elizabeth",HISTORY,386,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
History of American Jews,"Jews today are one of the most visible minorities in the United States: college educated, high income, steadfast supporters of the Democratic party. But it wasn’t always this way. How did a poor immigrant group become American and how did they manage to stay Jewish at the same time? This course explores a series of overlapping questions. How should American Jews be understood: As an American minority group? a dissenting non-Christian religious group? an immigrant and ethnic group? as a privileged white group? a cultural group? Employing the visual and aural dimensions of Jewish culture, including film, photography, music, and television along with readings in original documents and historical texts, the course suggests that studying American Jews challenges accepted interpretations of American history. Why for example, does the Jewish American poet Emma Lazarus’s sonnet “The New Colossus” adorn the Statue of Liberty? Why did the deaths of so many Jewish and Italian working women in Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire dramatically change labor laws in the U.S.?","Dash Moore, Deborah  ",HISTORY,387,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Black Feminist Thought and Practice,"What is Black Feminism? In this course, we will explore the history of Black women’s gendered and racial politics in the United States and, in particular, how their beliefs and experiences have differed from other groups. How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism. Course readings are drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods with the goal of exposing students to the history of Black Feminist thought and the breadth of Black Feminist scholarship, activism, and methodologies. By the end of the semester, students will be conversant in the major concepts of Black Feminism and Black Women’s Studies and have developed the analytical tools to understand how race, gender, and class interact to produce the unique experiences of Black women in the United States.","Strongman,Saraellen",HISTORY,388,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Black Feminism(s),3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics Mini-Course,"How did cellulose fiber paper become a globally circulated technology after its invention in Han China? How did Islam spread out from the Middle East to Central and East Asia? What role does infrastructure play in the contemporary rejuvenation of the Silk Road? This course will lead students to a new perspective of transnational history and examine China and the Middle East as interconnected and mutually constituted entities. The course moves chronologically from the Ancient Silk Road (2BCE-18CE) to the contemporary Belt and Road Initiative (2013- ), and depicts a grand picture of long-durée communications between two geographical areas. We shall focus on the contours of material exchanges, technology transfers, long-distance traveling, and the spread of ideas and religious beliefs. This course will motivate students to think critically about the relationships between material and culture, institution and politics, environment and human practice in a global framework.
Course Objectives
The thematical objective of this course is to promote students’ dedication to cultural diversity in the contemporary context of globalization. History serves to keep records of past events, yet more crucially, to illuminate people’s thoughts and shape their behaviors. A necessary step of cultural diversity is to know, acknowledge, and appreciate people and things beyond the realm of our life and take them as a critical reflection of the self. In this course, students can expect to learn how communications and exchanges were established between China and the Middle East, as well as how they were influenced by various global or regional factors.","Li,Xiaoyue",HISTORY,390,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - China and the Middle East: Commodities, Ecology, Infrastructure",2,,Minicourse,,,May be elected three times for credit.  ,

Covering different historical periods and different refugee communities, this writing-intensive capstone seminar will address the history of the legal regulation of refugee migrations; the political debates surrounding refugees; the significance of religion, race, ethnicity, and national identity in refugee history; and the experiences of refugees in resettling and establishing a new life in a new society. We will take a transnational view of forced migration, with attention to the ways that war, empire, and foreign policy have shaped refugees’ lives. We will explore refugee experiences by reading recent historical literature and considering a rich array of the primary source material, including fiction, memoirs, government documents, oral history interviews, films, and maps. In particular, students will engage in the refugee oral histories collected through the Religion and Resettlement Project at Princeton University and produce writing that facilitates the public dissemination of that research.","Borja,Melissa M",HISTORY,399,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Refugees in America,4,ULWR,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  ,

The Politics of Civil Liberties and Civil Rights,"This course focuses on landmark civil rights decisions of the Supreme Court, which elaborate the constitutional doctrine of “equal protection” and are a lens through which we can view America’s unfolding struggle over race. Situated at the nexus of law, politics, and history, the course explores the links between civil rights decisions and wider social, political, and economic contexts. Organized roughly chronologically, the course covers the following major topics: the political crisis over slavery; the law and politics of Reconstruction; the Jim Crow era; the legal construction of “whiteness” in the law of naturalized citizenship; the Japanese-American internment during World War II; “war on terror” cases involving the Guantanamo Bay detainees; and the Trump Administration’s Travel Ban. The course also includes a unit on the law and politics of the Civil Rights Era, which covers the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. The overall goal of the course is to explore the nature of Supreme Court decision-making, the relationship of the Court to the other branches of government and, generally, the role of the Supreme Court in American politics. Themes running throughout the course include “equality” as a contested concept, race and ethnic politics, and constructions of American identity.

Indian Religions and Western Thought,"This course examines the intellectual and cultural encounter between India and the West from the 1770s to the present day, a period that coincides with the entry of India into the historical experience of colonialism and modernity. It looks at how the discovery of knowledge about India affected debates in modern European philosophy and conversely examines the reception of European ideas in modern Indian thought. One of the outcomes of this encounter is that national culture in India and Europe developed in relation to a shared experience of colonialism in which notions of religion and secularity were crucial in evolving the idea of the nation in both regions. This course will examine how Western discourses of race, religion, secularity, gender, and spirituality were internalized by Indian elites and eventually deployed in the formation of socio-political and religious movements of reform and anti-colonial resistance. We shall look at how these reform movements shaped the nationalization of three distinct communities in colonial North India - Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh – and how encounters between these communities and the British helped to define some of the central problems of Indian democracy today.","Mandair,Arvind-Pal Singh",HISTORY,422,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,Junior and above.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Russia Under the Tsars: From Peter the Great to the Revolutions of 1917,"



A powerful state and imposing international military force are shaken under the pressures of terrorism, political extremism, and fiscal irresponsibility, exacerbated by the pressures of unending war. This may sound like the US today, but it refers here to the historical experience of Russia, 1917. In this unusual team-taught course, we will study the currents of Russian and Western thought that clashed and combined to form a uniquely Russian cultural mix in the centuries between 1700 and 1917. Beginning with the reign of Peter the Great (1682-1725), the Russian Empire began a long and difficult process of economic, social, and cultural development within the framework of tsarist autocracy. Russian elites came to set the standards for the European world with their cultural production -- great music, ballet, literature, art, philosophy, and science -- but they built their glittering world on the back of oppressed peasants. At the same time, imperial forces swept across the Eurasian continent, building a vast, religiously and ethnically diverse empire. For two centuries the emperors and empresses held together their many lands and peoples through a combination of repression and reform. By the early 20th century tsarism proved to be unable to resist any longer the social forces it had done so much to create.

Topics in History,"How can an ideology that seems to fit so perfectly the needs of a particular national experience adapt to many different historical, social, and economic contexts? In its global approach to fascism, this course aims to show that since its theorization in the early twentieth century, this ideology has produced similar trends in state violence in disparate geographical spaces. We will begin the class by defining fascism and looking at how it was precisely through a set of cultural practices that it was able to implement its powerful ideology—in varying forms, with varying degrees of success—in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and across the Atlantic in Brazil, Argentina, and the US.  We will read the American novel It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis and we will watch Italian films that show the conditions under which fascism was developed.

Topics in Middle Eastern History,"After examining Islam as a concept (or, rather, an array of different conceptualizations), a subject of academic inquiry, and an intellectual challenge (in terms of defining what is included into and excluded from this elastic category), we will undertake a comparative exploration of Islamic discursive theology (kalam), legal theory (fiqh), philosophy (falsafa), and modern-day Islamic reformism (islah) and “fundamentalism” (Salafism; salafiyya). We will pay special attention to the question of how these diverse fields of intellectual endeavor – varying in methodology and purpose – have conceived of God and his relationship with the world he created, especially the world of human beings. Islamic doctrines and practices have always evolved within concrete socio-political circumstances that decisively, if indirectly, shaped their evolution across time and space. Recent and current debates inside and outside the Muslim world over current and future directions of Islamic thought and practice, as well as the burning geopolitical issues faced by the global Muslim community (umma), will be discussed in detail. Last, but not least, we will evaluate the usefulness and suitability of recent Western sociological, hermeneutic, and anthropological methodologies in explaining the intellectual, ritual, and spiritual aspects of the life of the umma. We will also attempt to formulate and propose new, original ways of approaching the complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that we call “Islam.”","Knysh,Alexander D",HISTORY,449,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Islamic Intellectual History,3,ULWR,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Japan to 1700:  Origin Myth to Shogun Dynasty,"What lies behind the image of “Cool Japan,” represented by fuzzy robots, Super Mario, Toto toilets, and everything that is kawaii? The answer is Japan’s long, complex and intriguing past that stretches from the mythical age of gods and goddesses through our time. This course covers most of that history, from prehistory and the age of aristocrats to the rise of the samurai and their dominance both in total war and total peace (300BCE and 1700CE). We examine patterns of transformation along the twin axes of time and theme: ancient aristocrats’ political power and aesthetic authority; medieval militarism supported by land rights, urban economy, and sea power; and the early modern consolidation of the status order and overseas relations. Along the way, we visit issues of environment and disasters, blood and pollution, religious devotion and sexuality, Christianity and trade, family and gender, death and dying, and more. The course offers samples of translated primary sources, such as tales, chronicles, diaries, and documents, as well as scholarly essays, films, and video clips. They will expose students to the diversity of ideas and practices that emerged from the Japanese archipelago, different from our universalistic assumptions, often shaped by the knowledge of the West. These materials and our discussion should also lead students to question the notion of “the Japanese tradition,” much of which was constructed in modern times, and does a disservice to Japan’s premodern past through misrepresentation.","Tonomura,Hitomi",HISTORY,450,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Conversions and Christianities in the Early Modern World and Beyond,"


Our seminar investigates change of various kinds, especially religious transformations and the ways in which people's identities and allegiances are dynamic and the products of interactive emergence. We explore the points of view of those who carried and promoted religion -- and other would-be universal brands -- to others, but also the perspectives of those on the ""receiving end,"" curious about them not only as users, but also as co-creators and re-makers of local systems of belief and practice. 

A predominant focus will be the remarkable proliferation of Catholic Christianities in the expanding Spanish world between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries. But, in order to avoid seeing this phenomena and period in splendid isolation, we also examine mobility of religion and culture in Europe and the circum-Mediterranean in the Late Antique and Medieval periods, and indeed in other far broader geographical and temporal frames. 

Along the way, we will also discuss and employ an array of methods and approaches to historical interpretation, with ""thinking tools"" drawn from an array of disciplines, most notably anthropology and literature.  Students will be challenged to consider their own lives and surrounding cultures as emergent, as experiences and tellings and transformations.Course Requirements:Students will be evaluated on: Preparation for, and Engagement and Participation in, Discussion; a series of Short Writing Assignments; Constructive Criticism of peers' drafts and their Own Revisions in response to comments; a Culminating Research ProjectIntended Audience:Upper-level undergraduates (Hist 487) PhD candidates (Hist 594),Class Format:Seminar.","Mills,Kenneth",HISTORY,487,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Topics in History: HistoryLabs II,"In this research seminar, students will research and write about the racial histories of small towns in the U.S. We will focus especially on suspected “sundown towns.” Sundown towns refer to places where residents drove out or actively excluded specific groups from residing there (from being in a town after sunset) through ordinances, signs, and acts of violence. Sundown towns excluded Black people, and in some cases, Chinese Americans, Jewish people, and other racialized groups. Since the 19th century, these towns have been prevalent throughout the U.S. and especially in the Midwest, West, and East. Students will conduct research into these towns and work collaboratively to contribute their findings to a website devoted to documenting the history of sundown towns. Students will also research and write about the racial past of a town they choose, exploring the racial groups and interracial interactions in that place. We will research local records, including in libraries and archives, census records, local histories, and oral histories. Public-facing goals include educating the public about sundown towns and working with local communities on how to respond to these troubling histories through acknowledgment and through concrete steps toward racial justice in their communities.","Berrey,Stephen",HISTORY,491,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Race, Local History, and Sundown Towns",3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Topics in History: HistoryLabs II,"This research seminar is a HistoryLab course that will work with the London Metropolitan Archive (LMA) to explore daily life in medieval London through last wills and testaments. Thousands of ordinary men and women wrote last wills. Will reveal a great deal about Londoners’ mobility, family life, religion, material culture, professional networks, and the different priorities of men and women. The wills we will be working with come from London’s Commissary Court and cover the dates 1484-1487; dates which cover the War of the Roses and the accession of Henry VII, the first Tudor monarch. Thus, one of the questions for the course will be how major political events register in the daily lives of people, who are not on the battlefront. Ability to travel, language, handwriting, and lack of legal knowledge all hinder access to medieval documents. A major goal of this project will be to work with the LMA to make these wills better known to scholars, genealogists, and the interested public. Most of the wills in this register are in English rather than Latin and the LMA has digitized them for our use. Members of the seminar will work in teams, learning how to read and transcribe these sources and collaborate in creating an online museum-style digital exhibit that combines qualitative, and quantitative analysis with interactive maps and reproductions of key documents.","French,Katherine L",HISTORY,491,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Living and Dying in Late Medieval London,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

It also looks at the ways in which American philosophical and literary traditions have engaged with Islamic themes. It is underlined that Islam has a long indigenous tradition in North America that predates Puritanism, but we do look at waves of immigration (1880-1924 and 1965-), and the place of Muslims in them. The main ethnic groups of American Islam-- African-Americans, whites, and Latinos/as, Arab-Americans and South Asian Americans, will all be considered.

History Colloquium,"What do Venice, New York, and Chicago have in common? All were described as possessing ghettos where Jews lived. And what do Berlin, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Miami have in common? All were considered new cities for Jews, places where Jews left the ghetto behind. This course looks at these European and American cities to examine how the ghetto got its name and its reputation as a quintessentially Jewish urban space and then how the ghetto lost its Jewish associations as Jews moved to new cities and new neighborhoods. Given these changes, how should we understand Nazi ghettos and African American ghettos? Some of these cities and neighborhoods possessed low-density suburban attributes; others retained high density but nonetheless seemed a different, distant world from the old, foreign, oppressive ghetto. This transregional excursion into Jewish urban experiences will illuminate how they shaped contemporary understandings of what makes a city.","Dash Moore, Deborah  ",HISTORY,497,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - From Ghetto to Suburb,4,,,HISTORY 202.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).  ,

From the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century, through the multiple rebellions in 1848, the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and the instability that led to the First World War, the spirit of revolution ran strong in the 19th century.

How do the early beginnings that emphasize a strict adherence to musical form reflect the social upheaval brought on through the French Revolution? In a time of strong juxtapositions, how does the symphony articulate the aesthetics of the sublime and the beautiful, the monumental and the miniature, the public and the private, the individual and the nation?

Race and Identity in Music,"This course explores the parameters of racial and ethnic identities in music. From the discourse surrounding exoticism and Orientalism, to the effects of evocative instrumentation, the use of dialect, and foreign subjects, the focus of this class is to understand how racial and ethnic difference can be portrayed musically. Musical case studies will be drawn from the nineteenth century through the present with a strong emphasis on the genre of opera.  Central questions to be raised are: how is racial/ethnic difference expressed musically? Who is representing whom? What is the intersection between the original performing context and our understanding of these works today? This course encourages interdisciplinary dialogue. Readings will be drawn from post-colonial and cultural studies as well as musicology.","Andre,Naomi A",HONORS,354,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Race and Identity in Music,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Global Perspectives on the HIV and AIDS Epidemic,"Beginning in 1981 when the first case of HIV was diagnosed, the HIV and AIDs epidemic has dramatically altered the social, cultural, economic, political and demographic landscape worldwide. Understanding the drivers and the implications of this epidemic of individuals, families, communities and countries requires insight into the myriad of biological, socio-cultural and political factors that shape individual knowledge and behavior, access to preventive and treatment modalities, as well as the political and international responses to the epidemic. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the social and behavioral factors that influence the transmission and prevention of HIV and AIDs worldwide. Topics to be covered include the natural history and epidemiology of the AIDS virus, the mechanisms of transmission, high risk and vulnerable populations, social determinants of risk and vulnerability, theoretical foundations for HIV prevention programs, primary and secondary HIV prevention strategies, treatment of HIV and AIDS, and implications of HIV and AIDS for individuals, families, communities and countries.
By the conclusion of this course, students will:
Have a general understanding of HIV and AIDS- how it’s transmitted and develops into AIDS.
Understand the history, context, biology and epidemiology of the HIV and AIDS epidemic worldwide.
Understand the biological, behavioral, psychosocial, economic, cultural and political factors that shape people’s risk for HIV, and underlying the underlying causes of these factors.
Understand the specific behavioral, biomedical and structural intervention approaches designed to reduce HIV and its consequences.
Understand the social, economic, cultural, political and demographic consequences of the HIV and AIDS epidemic globally.Intended Audience:First and second year students interested in the topic.Class Format:This class utilizes mixed method approaches that include course readings, lectures, in-class and online discussions, group presentations, and guest presentations from public health practitioners and experts in the field of HIV and AIDS.

What is History?,"You might think you know what history is: it’s what happened in the past — the names, dates, and events that fill textbooks. But think again. History is not about memorizing facts. It’s about asking questions about the past, finding clues, and using our imaginations to piece those clues together into stories — stories that shape our present and future. • Does this mean history is fiction? • Who gets to do history — whose stories should we accept as true? • How is history different in different parts of the world? • How do political struggles, in the U.S. and around the globe, shape the way people see the past and use it in their everyday lives? • Can history predict or improve the future, and if not, what is history for? • Must histories only be written in books? Or are there other sites that ""produce"" history? Put another way, where can we ""find"" history? This course will introduce you to various approaches to history, drawing examples from across the globe and throughout the centuries. But above all, it will teach you new ways of thinking critically and internationally about the world you live in — its past, present, and future. And it will help you prepare for any future courses or endeavors that require you to assess different kinds of evidence, grapple with conflicting interpretations about a topic, engage in critical inquiry and analysis, to craft an argument, and to develop empathy through historical or cultural understanding. Book Cost: One paperback book (used copies of the book are generally available).","Alberto,Paulina Laura",INTLSTD,205,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Topics in International Studies,"How did ‘human rights’ become today’s moral language? Visible in the press, social media, blogs, tweets, etc. human rights have become the dominant frame by which recent generations frame their idealism. Contrary to conventional wisdom, ‘human rights’, as a moral lens through which to see the world, did not always exist. Instead, ‘human rights’, both as a practice and a discourse, are a post-WWII phenomenon with roots in the European Enlightenment.

This course focuses on the longer history of how categories such a ‘humanity’ and ‘rights’ came about, how they were combined and put to use in the last two centuries. Herein, the course outlines the longer winding history of human rights as both a regime of inclusion and exclusion. Herein, special attention is placed on:
  The rise of international law in the context of shifting international politics in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
 The interaction of various groups with international law and the language of human rights
 The challenges that accompany the invention and application of international norms and laws.


It is the goal of this course to perhaps surprise. A critical historical study will reveal the controversial nature of ideals that are generally taken for granted.Intended Audience:Priority given to International Studies majors.","Tanielian,Melanie Schulze",INTLSTD,301,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - History and Practice of Human Rights,4,,,INTLSTD 101.,,May be elected twice for credit.

Conflict and Comics: Reframing the Middle East,"In recent decades, comics have evolved into a powerful medium for telling stories about conflicts in the Middle East, whether through autobiographical narratives or journalistic reports. The accessibility of comics as a kind of global language enables artists to convey the heavy toll that political strife, revolution, and war takes on soldiers and civilians. This course considers the development of comics reportage and memoir through the famous examples of Joe Sacco’s Palestine (1993-1995) and Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis (2000-2001). We then explore comics concerning civil and interstate wars in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Iraq, comparing works illustrated from the perspective of Western travelers with those written by natives to the Middle East or children of refugees. We also contrast printed formats with online comics, such as the 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning “Welcome to the New World,” asking ourselves how digital platforms have reshaped comics and our reading experience.","Barzilai,Maya",INTLSTD,308,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Atlantic Slavery and the Making of the Modern World,"This upper-level seminar will examine systems of unfree labor in Africa and the Americas during the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade. Beginning with European colonization of the Americas and ending with the emancipations of the nineteenth century, the course will explore the labor and cultural practices of enslaved people as well as the evolution of slavery as a legal and economic institution. Although slavery was a global institution, we will pay special attention to the way that the organization of labor and the heritage of slavers and slaves created different societies in different parts of the Americas. We will also consider longstanding debates in the history of slavery such as the origins of racial slavery and forms of slave resistance. And throughout the course we will always consider the legacy of Atlantic slavery and how it continues to unfold in the problems and promises of our world today.","Spooner,Matthew Patrick",INTLSTD,310,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
International and/or Comparative Topics in the Humanities,"What does it mean to be “black” in Jewish culture?

Delving into the parallel struggles of Blacks and Jews, we ask: How does the history of slavery intersect with the status of Jews in the Middle East? What connections can be drawn between the civil rights struggles in Israel and America? Throughout the course, we discuss the flexible and interrelated nature of the categories of Blackness and Jewishness across different historical, geographical, and temporal contexts. Themes explored include black and Jewish anti-colonial thought; Ethiopian and North African Jewish history; race and racism within the Middle East. By the end of the course, students will better understand how diasporic and racial identities are constructed and reconstructed over time and space.","Roby,Bryan Karle",INTLSTD,384,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Blackness and Jewishness: A History of Encounters,3,HU,,INTLSTD 101.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 10 credit(s).

Drawing on anthropological approaches to economic exchange and material culture, we will cover how consumer goods can materialize social relations, redefine local and national identities, and confuse consumption with citizenship. We will also examine the role of advertising, branding, and the power of multinational corporations to influence local practices in places as diverse as Hungary, Vietnam, the United States, Sweden, and Nepal.

What are medicine’s ethics, symbols, economies, experiences of the body, and politics? What happens when these things run up against other ways of viewing the world? In this course, through scholarship and popular media, and through the instructor’s experiences as a practicing physician and anthropologist, we will explore mind-bending paradoxes about what we assume to be true, explore aspects of medical practice, and describe why those practices often have unexpected results when they travel.","Stonington,Scott",INTLSTD,385,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - The Globalization of Biomedicine,4,SS,,INTLSTD 101.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 10 credit(s).

This course introduces the early period of Latin American history. We begin by exploring Amerindian civilizations on the eve of European arrival in the Americas, before turning to the Iberian Peninsula in the years leading up and through Spanish and Portuguese expansion. We study interactions among Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans, and the emergence of multi-ethnic societies, political and religious cultures in what might most accurately be called a New World for all. Primary sources – both texts and images – are our principal points of entry for understanding colonial systems, work regimes, tensions and conflicts, and evolving identities within “colonial Latin America.” Our focus extends into late eighteenth-century when a variety of struggles and rebellions across the region anticipated independence movements in the early nineteenth century.

International Studies Advanced Seminar,"This course follows the development of humanitarian action from its inception to the present. Today, we are witnessing a major transformation of humanitarian action. The geopolitical changes unfolding from the end of the Cold War and the global war on terrorism have profoundly shifted the environment in which humanitarian actions and interventions take place. These changes—and proposed ways of responding to them—are triggering heated debates about both philosophical and operational issues within the humanitarian community. Long-held principles, such as neutrality and impartiality are being questioned and at times even discarded. The range of humanitarian actors has broadened to include celebrities and for-profit firms. Some scholars contend that it is time to rethink the enterprise. Others believe that the present is not a time that calls for reconsidering basic principles. This class will challenge students to consider the basic principles, analytical frameworks, and activities required to protect the lives and dignity of people affected by crisis and conflict.","Uehling,Greta L",INTLSTD,401,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Humanitarian Dilemmas,3,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,
International Studies Advanced Seminar,"This interdisciplinary course explores the gendered nature of war and peace. The conventional wisdom surrounding war suggests that it is a quintessentially masculine realm, missing the complex and varied roles that both men and women play in waging war and forging peace. Students will be exposed to a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding the relationships between gender, armed conflict, and peacebuilding with the goal of developing analytic tools for considering war and peace across both time and space.

Readings will be drawn from history, sociology, anthropology, international relations, literature, diaries and memoirs, and the popular press. Course assessment will be based on participation in discussion, written reflections on readings, one presentation, and a final paper analyzing the gendered dimensions of a specific conflict or peace-building effort. Efforts will be made to incorporate all four International Studies sub plans.

As a result of the course, students will be able to:

 Demonstrate insight into the central themes in the study of gender in peace and conflict research.
 Be aware of different approaches to and perspectives on the gendered aspects of war and peace in existing scholarly knowledge.
 Identify institutional actors, processes, and efforts to address the gendered nature of armed violence and respond to the demands for building more equal post-war societies.
 Design and carry-out an analytical writing task, using a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, on a topic relevant to the course.

International Studies Advanced Seminar,"This course explores the reconstruction of public health as a central factor for domestic and international actors to address in postwar transitions. First, we will examine how violence on the battlefield has direct and indirect effects on the health of individuals in the postwar era. War directly affects individuals overall well-being, ranging from the physical traumas suffered to the emergence of infectious diseases and mental problems. Civilians and soldiers alike suffer the short-term risks of morbidity and mortality when they cannot access basic nutrition, water, or health services. The next part of the course turns to the indirect effects, that the conflict has likely diminished or eliminated the underlying social systems and institutions that provided the population with basic health care services. The long-term costs include the diversion of essential resources to the fight and the massive rebuilding costs of the infrastructure to promote basic health outcomes. Finally, the course will consider whether the provision of public health and the attending professionals can reduce the likelihood of a return to violence. Examples covered in the course will include Syria, the former Yugoslavia, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.

In the course, students will critically assess various theoretical and policy perspectives to address the health consequences of fighting to arrive at a broader understanding of possible intervention strategies to restore a society’s well being.Course Requirements:INTLSTD 401 has no testing components. All assignments are written papers and will be submitted via Canvas throughout the semester.Intended Audience:Juniors and Seniors in International Studies Majors and Minors.Class Format:We will have biweekly discussion sessions that require participation in various conversations.

International Studies Advanced Seminar,"This is an introduction to globalization, intercultural contact, and transnational relations as processes in the ancient or pre-modern world. We follow the journeys of, say, a trader, a pilgrim, or a soldier, who left home to explore the edges of their known world. How did ancient peoples cope with language barriers? How did they understand cultures and customs very different from those of their own? Why would anybody in the first place decide to leave their village, their hamlet, their home? We are probably motivated by similar reasons when we buy a plane ticket and pack our bags. And indeed globalization is nothing new: as you will learn in this class, the free flow of goods, people, and ideas is actually the oldest profession in the world.

International Studies: Special Topics,"How can an ideology that seems to fit so perfectly the needs of a particular national experience adapt to many different historical, social, and economic contexts? In its global approach to fascism, this course aims to show that since its theorization in the early twentieth century, this ideology has produced similar trends in state violence in disparate geographical spaces. We will begin the class by defining fascism and looking at how it was precisely through a set of cultural practices that it was able to implement its powerful ideology—in varying forms, with varying degrees of success—in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and across the Atlantic in Brazil, Argentina, and the US.  We will read the American novel It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis and we will watch Italian films that show the conditions under which fascism was developed. We will also visit the University of Michigan Special Collections to look at the actual propagandistic fascist (and anti-fascist) materials.

Advanced topics in Comparative Culture and Identity,"Starting from the premise that race plays itself out visually, the course explores the relationship between art, materiality, space, and race. In addition to reading foundational literature in critical race studies including W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde, our inquiries will be grounded by five case studies: South Africa, Germany, India, Mexico, and the US. Each one of these cases will provide a conception of race rooted in local histories and cultures. By analyzing the visual and material dimensions of apartheid, antisemitism, xenophobia, slavery, and colonization through these case studies, we will articulate a multidimensional understanding of race as a historical concept. However, to ask how race has shaped visual culture also has global implications, as demonstrated by the recent removal of racists monuments across the world. Thus, by looking at each case study in comparison, students will develop an understanding of both the global and the local ramifications of racism and the antiracist movement. Objects, buildings, places, paintings, names, sculptures,s and public art will structure our weekly debates. Students will engage in visual analysis and independent research for their final assessment.","Rozas-Krause,Valentina Javiera",INTLSTD,489,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Visualizing Race Comparatively,3,,,INTLSTD 301.,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,

Humanities Topics in Islamic Studies,"What does it mean to love? As both a literary genre and a system of emotion, romance has played a crucial role in answering this question across the Middle East, from the novels of late antiquity (Greek and Latin) to medieval Islamic and Christian tales of love (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, French, and Georgian), including the great books of Layli & Majnun, the 1001 Nights, and the Haft Paykar. This class offers an introduction to the romantic tradition through a close reading of some of its prominent examples, with an eye for how they construct and subvert their own ideology: even as they vaunt chastity and fidelity, normative gender roles, and licit sex (typically heterosexual marriage) as ideal virtues, they simultaneously interrogate those ideals with numerous cases of betrayal, murder, castration, gender-bending, and illicit sex (incest, adultery). The role of women in society, and their agency in shaping their stories and destinies, lies at the center of this negotiation and will be a constant focal point for us throughout the course. Although we will connect these texts with modern examples, the bulk of our readings are drawn from the pre-modern period, which will afford us a better understanding of where romantic love comes from, and a diachronic view into points of difference and similarity with its modern incarnations. In this seminar class, students will develop a framework for critically unpacking contemporary notions of love, allowing them to reconsider how such seemingly universal experiences can be conditioned by society and culture, yet also to recognize the drives, emotions, and obsessions that we may know from our personal lives in people who lived and loved centuries ago and continents away.
For each session, active participation in class discussion, with students taking turns in leadership roles, will be expected. One blog post of about 500 words will be assigned every week, and every 2--3 weeks, a written assignment of 1250-1500 words will be due. A short reflection paper will be turned in at the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to develop your skills in critical reading, writing, thinking, and analysis.","Cross,Cameron",ISLAM,392,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003," - Sin, Sex, and Desire: Romance in the Middle East",3,HU,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

Islamic Movements in Comparative Perspective,"This course examines the rise and evolution of political and social movements that derive their distinctive identity from Islam by appealing to its foundational ideas and values and acting in its name and/or in the name of God. We will analyze the causes, origins, strategies, goals, and relations with state authorities of such movements in different areas of the Muslim world and in the countries in which Muslims constitute a substantial minority. After a brief introduction to Islam as a religious, cultural, and political tradition and social system, we will address the phenomenon of so-called “political Islam” in the modern age (late nineteenth century-present), its historical roots, and theological-juridical underpinnings. While the ideological premises shared by all the major Islamic movements are extremely important, we will focus on the diversity of political and social agendas of such movements in various regional contexts. The role of the political, social, and cyber environments (the Internet) in which regional Islamic movements evolve and operate will receive special attention. The course features a number of recent documentary films as well as sessions conducted by foreign and local guest speakers with expertise in different regional manifestations of Islamic/Islamist politics.","Knysh,Alexander D",ISLAM,411,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,Introductory course on Islam (i.e. NEAREAST 216).,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Islamic Intellectual History,"After examining Islam as a concept (or, rather, an array of different conceptualizations), a subject of academic inquiry, and an intellectual challenge (in terms of defining what is included into and excluded from this elastic category), we will undertake a comparative exploration of Islamic discursive theology (kalam), legal theory (fiqh), philosophy (falsafa), and modern-day Islamic reformism (islah) and “fundamentalism” (Salafism; salafiyya). We will pay special attention to the question of how these diverse fields of intellectual endeavor – varying in methodology and purpose – have conceived of God and his relationship with the world he created, especially the world of human beings. Islamic doctrines and practices have always evolved within concrete socio-political circumstances that decisively, if indirectly, shaped their evolution across time and space. Recent and current debates inside and outside the Muslim world over current and future directions of Islamic thought and practice, as well as the burning geopolitical issues faced by the global Muslim community (umma), will be discussed in detail. Last, but not least, we will evaluate the usefulness and suitability of recent Western sociological, hermeneutic, and anthropological methodologies in explaining the intellectual, ritual, and spiritual aspects of the life of the umma. We will also attempt to formulate and propose new, original ways of approaching the complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that we call “Islam.”","Knysh,Alexander D",ISLAM,424,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,ULWR,,Taught in English.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

"Second-Year Italian, Continued","This course, “Translating Oral History: A Story of Fascism, Colonialism, WW II, and Identity,” is centered around an interview that is part of the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University.  Thanks to the Language Resource Center, we have gained access to this interview. During Winter semester 2021, students in Italian 232 transcribed the interview. In this class, we will work from their transcription and produce a translation from Italian into English so that the English-speaking world can learn more about history.  As such, this offers students a unique opportunity to work in groups and learn experientially.  Additionally, we will contribute to and advance the important work that is being done at Yale to make the stories of men and women who lived during the Holocaust heard. We will be using a video of an interview done at Yale in 1987 of Maria Gilda, a woman who grew up in an Italian community in Tunisia and lived there from the 1920s to the 1960s.  After moving away, she became a French citizen and lived the rest of her life in France. This is a 45-minute video in which she tells the story of her life.  Through her story, we see a different narrative of war and we can dissect and discuss Maria Gilda’s complex identity as an Italian-Jewish woman who was born in Tunisia and became French.  This video will make up the central piece of content in the course in addition to other readings so that we can better understand Maria Gilda’s place and time in history.  We will do brief readings/viewings on Fascism, World War II, colonialism, and oral history. Through Maria Gilda’s story, we will flesh out the big stakes of history from her point of view.  This aspect of history (compared to History with a capital H) will also be the way in which we will enrich our knowledge of the Italian language.  In addition to the content provided by the video and brief excerpts of readings, our focus on grammar will come from the textbook, Immagina. In Maria Gilda’s interview, there is a plethora of grammatical structures at work and in each chapter, we will be on the hunt for those structures in the interview and we will use them to describe what we are learning from and about Maria Gilda’s life. The objectives of this course will mirror those of a typical Italian 232 in terms of the advancement of the four skills—reading, writing, speaking and listening.  Furthermore, we will dedicate class time to reflectivity, and conversations about culture and history.","Lasker-Ferretti,Janaya S",ITALIAN,232,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Translating Oral History: A Story of Fascism, Colonialism, WW II & Identity",4,,Lang Req,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

From its origins in nineteenth-century Sicily to its global reach today, we study the mafia as a business model, a cultural phenomenon, a social structure, a form of terrorism, and a challenge to international policing. Topics covered include representations of the mafia as an indigenous Sicilian movement, protecting the property and the rights of Sicilians; laws enacted to fight the mafia; and the antimafia, a youth movement that works to reclaim land and property from the mafia. We study the spread of mafia crime in the US, from New Orleans in the nineteenth century to New York, Las Vegas, and Chicago in the twentieth century. Students also research the little-known history of the Detroit mafia, who exploited the presence of the auto industry and the Teamsters Union, the proximity of the Canadian border, and their ties in Sicily, between Prohibition and the 1990s.","Mallette,Karla",ITALIAN,240,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

We will begin the class by defining fascism and looking at how it was precisely through a set of cultural practices that it was able to implement its powerful ideology—in varying forms, with varying degrees of success—in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and across the Atlantic in Brazil, Argentina, and the US.  We will read the American novel It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis and we will watch Italian films that show the conditions under which fascism was developed.

The course integrates a trans-stylistic approach to improvisation, composition, keyboard skills, harmony, melody, aural skills, rhythm and analysis within a hands-on format which utilizes resources from diverse musical traditions. Students bring their instruments to class, and they improvise, compose, sing and play all concepts covered at the keyboard as well on their major instruments. Rhythmic training utilizes principles from African, South Indian and Brazilian music. Improvisation is undertaken in jazz, globally-influenced, contemporary classical and figured bass styles. Harmonic training draws from Jazz and European classical music, with keyboard realization as the primary learning vehicle. Students learn to be pianistically 'bilingual'--able to play contemporary jazz/pop chord symbols, and baroque figured bass 'chord changes'. This integration of jazz and classical sources is also central to the writing component of the class, where as an alternative to the four-part chorale context which is central to much theory training, the class uses a keyboard-style written approach which, in fact, is rooted in both baroque and jazz traditions.","Kirschenmann,Mark Steven",JAZZ,220,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,CE,,SEE BULLETIN.,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.

First Year Seminar in Judaic Studies,"Did young Jewish men and women fall in love in the old days? What was the place of love in traditional Jewish society? How did ideas about love, romance, and marriage change with time? 
 We will address these and other important questions about Jewish life by looking closely at stories written in Yiddish in the 19th and 20th centuries in Russia, Poland, and America. We will explore the ways Yiddish writers portrayed romantic feelings, study their literary techniques and devices, and create our own interpretations of their works. We will read and discuss stories by the classic authors of Yiddish literature — Sholem Aleichem, and Y.L. Peretz — as well as by their younger followers and opponents, including Dovid Bergelson, Sholem Asch, I.B. Singer, Rokhl Korn, Kadya Molodowsky.

What is Judaism?,"What has it meant to eat as a Jew, dress as a Jew, or pray as a Jew in different time periods and locales? How do the Sabbath laws inscribed in the Hebrew Bible relate to Jewish practices of rest and celebration in the modern period? This course familiarizes students with the central sacred texts and practices of Jewish traditions as they have been interpreted by different communities over the past 2000 years. We study the development of Jewish thought and practice through a series of different lens--theology, history, ethnography, and feminism among others. By exploring the diverse history of Jewish practice, students gain insight into contemporary debates in the Jewish world: questions such as who is a Jew, which practices define Judaism as a religion in the modern world, and what does a flourishing Jewish community look like.","Ginsburg,Elliot K",JUDAIC,205,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Humanities Topics in Judaism," Judeo-Spanish, also called Ladino, Judezmo, and Spanyolit, is a Romance language written and spoken by Sephardic Jews (Jews of Spanish and Portuguese background). Judeo-Spanish originated in the Iberian Peninsula and was carried abroad after Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497. This language is an archaic form of Castilian Spanish that contains elements of Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, Turkish, Greek, French, Portuguese, Bulgarian, and Italian.  
 Written and spoken in areas such as Israel, the Balkans, North Africa, Greece, Turkey (and to a lesser extent also in the Americas), today Judeo-Spanish is in danger of extinction – although it is experiencing some kind of revival. We are taking part in this revival by learning it here in Michigan! Judeo-Spanish is usually written in Hebrew script, but in the 21st century, it is more commonly written with the Latin alphabet. 
 This course introduces the Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) language in its cultural context. Students will develop basic reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills in Judeo-Spanish. We will use Marie-Christine Varol’s textbook  Manual of Judeo-Spanish: Language and Culture  (2008). The course will cover chapters 1 to 3 of Varol’s textbook, which teaches Judeo-Spanish in Latin characters and includes accompanying listening activities.Class Format:","Mordoch,Gabriel",JUDAIC,218,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Introduction to Judeo-Spanish (Ladino),3,HU,,,,May be elected eight times for credit.

Screening Jewish Cultures,"This course explores the diversity of Jewish societies through a range of American, French, German and Israeli films, spanning the history of cinematic production. We begin with American immigrant cinema and consider how Jews negotiated the categories of race and ethnicity in films such as  The Jazz Singer,   Annie Hall,  and  A Serious Man.  Turning to Nazi cinema and post-Holocaust films produced in Germany, France, the U.S., and Israel, we interrogate the use of the medium for propaganda, documentation, and witnessing. The course also introduces students to Israel as an immigrant society and to the cinematic representation of Jewish and Arab minority groups. Throughout the course, we reflect on casting choices, language use and subtitling, cross-dressing, and genre choices, as these affect the cinematic construction of Jewishness in relationship to other social groups.","Barzilai,Maya",JUDAIC,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

"The Historical Jesus in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam","Everybody thinks they know Jesus, but who was he, really? What did he do? Who did he claim to be? What kind of a Jew was he? How did he become the founder of a new religion? The course focuses on the Jewish religious leader and messianic claimant, and founder of the Christian movement, Jesus of Nazareth (Jesus son of Joseph, Joshua bar-Yosef, Isa), as a historical character. By examining all extant historical sources (Jewish, Christian, and Islamic), the course offers a critical reconstruction of the major stages of the life and deeds of the prophet from Nazareth, from his birth under Herod the Great to his death and crucifixion under Pontius Pilate, within the diverse world of Second Temple Judaism. In particular, the course explores the ever-changing interpretations of Jesus in modern and contemporary Christianity, Judaism, and Islam to the present.","Zurawski,Jason M",JUDAIC,280,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Humanities Topics in Judaism,"What does it mean to be “black” in Jewish culture? In this course, we explore how Jewish societies have understood and engaged with Blackness and Black peoples over the ages. Delving into the parallel struggles of Blacks and Jews, we ask: How does the history of slavery intersect with the status of Jews in the Middle East? What connections can be drawn between the civil rights struggles in Israel and America? Throughout the course, we discuss the flexible and interrelated nature of the categories of Blackness and Jewishness across different historical, geographical, and temporal contexts. Themes explored include black and Jewish anti-colonial thought; Ethiopian and North African Jewish history; race and racism within the Middle East. By the end of the course, students will better understand how diasporic and racial identities are constructed and reconstructed over time and space.","Roby,Bryan Karle",JUDAIC,318,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Blackness and Jewishness: A History of Encounters,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Jewish Americans have long experienced many forms of in-betweenness (insider/outsider, ""model minority""/marginalized, White/racialized ""Other,"" etc.). In this course, students will gain first-hand knowledge of how American Jewish identity is conceived and represented, ranging from stand-up comedy to films about the Holocaust, from documentaries about Jewish tattooing to ethnographies about kosher butchers in small-town Iowa, and from Jewish hip hop artists to vampires. Students will come away with a better knowledge of what it means to ""be"" Jewish in the US and how that is represented, and how understanding Jewish identity lends to better understanding other identity issues.","Moshin,Jamie Eric",JUDAIC,318,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004, - Representing American Jewishness,4,"RE, HU",,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

History and Religion of Second Temple Judaism,"Evil. Why does it exist? How can a good God allow bad things to happen to good people? This is the question of theodicy, a problem that has plagued philosophers, theologians, and thinkers of all sorts for thousands of years. It is a question which has spurred more religious and spiritual innovation than perhaps any other. The answers developed to deal with such a profound problem are tied to the development of, for example, monotheism, messianism, the devil, heaven and hell, and many others. In this course, we will explore a fascinating and dynamic period of Jewish history: the Persian, Hellenistic, and early Roman eras, the time from which Judaism and Christianity as we know them today will emerge. We will explore the history of the period along with its extremely diverse body of literature, many texts of which fall outside standard religious canons but which were indeed canonical to those who read and used them, texts like the Dead Sea Scrolls. In this review, we will pay particular attention to the question of theodicy and the problem of evil and how it impacted nearly every major ideological and practical development we find from this period. From this class, we will discover just how profound an effect the question of evil had not only during the Second Temple period but on culture and civilization to this very day.","Zurawski,Jason M",JUDAIC,335,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Theodicy and the Problem of Evil,3,HU,,,,May be elected three times for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.
Legacy of the Holocaust in Yugoslav Culture: How and Why We Need to Narrate the Holocaust,"

The course’s primary focus is raising awareness about the historical and global persistence of racism and politics of intolerance that informs the daily lives of citizens. The reading list consists of new writings on the Holocaust created in response to the contemporary recurrence of various forms of racism, anti-Semitism, and right-wing politics in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Students will be encouraged to think about the resurrection of racist rhetoric manifested in ethnic particularism, strong anti-Semitic sentiments, and not infrequently, official anti-Roma politics. The course also makes a necessary link with racism underlying economic or even security arguments (be it the Arizona anti-immigrant law, the dislocation of the Roma by the Serbian or British governments for reasons of urban development, the abandonment of the boat with African immigrants by the Italian Navy, or the anti-Roma laws in Slovakia quoting crime prevention).
Since the rise in racism in Europe is linked to the fall of Communism, the enlargement of the EU, global migrations, as well as a long economic crisis, students will be invited to make connections between these social processes capable of producing seismic shifts and creating the fertile soil for the dissemination of racist ideas. Students will be encouraged to explore the link between the past and present, rather than read the primary texts as monuments to the past, the past that mankind keeps vowing will never repeat. Students will be invited to think why texts about the Holocaust can be particularly instructive about the reemergence of racist ideologies that are resurrected at times of social crisis.

Finally, to answer the question of “how” we write about the Holocaust, the reading list contains very diverse narrative techniques that in strange and painful ways immerse the reader in the position of the victim. The reading list consists of primary texts about the Holocaust in Eastern Europe and the Balkans that frequently treat the subject in novel and unexpected ways. The secondary literature is composed of essays, excerpts, filmic and documentary material intended to foster discussion about racism and anti-Semitism not merely as the event of the past and firmly connected to the period of the Nazi occupation of Europe, but as a global occurrence that may and does affect our lives at present.Course Requirements:Evaluation: based on class participation, midterm presentation, final project (if paper, 10-12 pp, otherwise run your project idea with instructor prior to starting it), and the oral presentation of the project-paper, bi-weekly quizzes and weekly discussion questions.","Aleksic,Tatjana",JUDAIC,350,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

A Global History of the Jews of Spain,"1492 marked the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, which had been one of the most flourishing centers of the Jewish world. But the end of Jewish life in Spain did not mean the end of Spanish Jews; on the contrary, Sephardic Jews (as the Jews from the Iberian Peninsula are called) retain a distinct identity even today. This course traces the Jewish diaspora from Spain and Portugal with particular attention to how Sephardic Jews maintained ties of commerce, language, and identity across increasingly large distances. We begin with a brief overview of the history of Jews in Spain and Portugal. We then move on to examine the nature of Sephardic life in North Africa, the Middle East, Italy, Europe, and the Americas. Some questions we will explore include: how Sephardic Jews used their transnational ties to their coreligionists to advance their commercial interests; Sephardic Jewish identity as expressed through language, literature, and culture; and the unique ways in which Sephardic Jewry faced modernization. We will end the class by examining aspects of Sephardic Jews’ experience in Israel and America today, including how a number of Christians in the American Southwest are claiming a “crypto-Jewish” identity as the descendants of Marranos (Jews converted to Christianity).","Mays,Devi Elizabeth",JUDAIC,360,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,JUDAIC 205.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Israeli Culture and Society,"Since its establishment in 1948 until today, the State of Israel has unsettled, constantly shifting borders. At the same time, borders are rather difficult to cross in Israel/Palestine. This course will introduce students to the diversity of Israeli society and culture through the theme of borders and border crossing. Borders, borderlines, and border crossing will be explored in diverse arenas: geo-political, ethnic, linguistic, religious, gender, economic, and the intersections between them. Students will read and analyze a wide range of literature and cultural products (film, music, art, architecture, food) by Arabs and Jews, Mizrahi and Ashkenazi, religious and secular, natives and immigrants who express and examine these complex issues in their work.","Pinsker, Shachar  ",JUDAIC,373,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Borders and Border Crossing,3,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Women and the Bible,"This course is an interdisciplinary seminar that approaches the women of the Bible — from Eve, Sara, and Hagar through Miriam, Ruth, Judith, and Mary — within the broad critical perspective of gender and sexuality. We will discuss works by prominent feminist scholars who have critiqued patriarchal, heteronormative male culture and illuminated the field of biblical studies.

We will ask what kind of alternative tools, sensibilities, and knowledge one needs to engage with the “women’s communities” of the Bible, and what kind of old conventions one must leave behind.  In addition to learning how meaning is constructed in the Bible, we will explore the ways these foundational women have figured in history and contemporary culture in art, films, and poetry.","Tsoffar,Ruth",JUDAIC,376,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Feminist Readings,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
The Holocaust,"
The Holocaust — the persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945 — was one of the most horrific events in the history of the world. The atrocities committed in the heart of the twentieth-century threw into question the very notion of human progress, and continue to haunt humanity to this day. We have all seen images and films about the Holocaust, or have read literature and diaries from the time, but mostly we shy away from confronting the bigger questions that the Holocaust forces us to ask about ourselves and our history. This course will better equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to interpret representations of the Holocaust by grounding students with the factual basis on which these representations are made.  Students will learn to interpret some of the most important historical facts about the Holocaust, to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of contending explanations regarding the causes and effects of the Holocaust, and to contextualize the Holocaust.Course Requirements:Students will be evaluated on the basis of quizzes, writing assignments, and exams.Intended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:The course will be structured as a lecture with discussions.","Mays,Devi Elizabeth",JUDAIC,386,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
History of American Jews,"Jews today are one of the most visible minorities in the United States: college educated, high income, steadfast supporters of the Democratic party. But it wasn’t always this way. How did a poor immigrant group become American and how did they manage to stay Jewish at the same time? This course explores a series of overlapping questions. How should American Jews be understood: As an American minority group? a dissenting non-Christian religious group? an immigrant and ethnic group? as a privileged white group? a cultural group? Employing the visual and aural dimensions of Jewish culture, including film, photography, music, and television along with readings in original documents and historical texts, the course suggests that studying American Jews challenges accepted interpretations of American history. Why for example, does the Jewish American poet Emma Lazarus’s sonnet “The New Colossus” adorn the Statue of Liberty? Why did the deaths of so many Jewish and Italian working women in Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire dramatically change labor laws in the U.S.?","Dash Moore, Deborah  ",JUDAIC,387,"Fall 2021, ",Section 101,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Judaic Studies,"What do Venice, New York, and Chicago have in common? All were described as possessing ghettos where Jews lived. And what do Berlin, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Miami have in common? All were considered new cities for Jews, places where Jews left the ghetto behind. This course looks at these European and American cities to examine how the ghetto got its name and its reputation as a quintessentially Jewish urban space and then how the ghetto lost its Jewish associations as Jews moved to new cities and new neighborhoods. Given these changes, how should we understand Nazi ghettos and African American ghettos? Some of these cities and neighborhoods possessed low-density suburban attributes; others retained high density but nonetheless seemed a different, distant world from the old, foreign, oppressive ghetto. This transregional excursion into Jewish urban experiences will illuminate how they shaped contemporary understandings of what makes a city.","Dash Moore, Deborah  ",JUDAIC,417,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - From Ghetto to Suburb: Jewish Urban Experiences in Europe and the U.S.,3,,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

Topics in Judaic Studies,"Where does Antisemitism come from? How has it survived into the modern-day? To find an answer, we have to look back in time, long before the conflicts of the Holocaust, to the origins of European Christianity.  Throughout the Middle Ages, Christianity compared itself in to Judaism, and this rivalry was nowhere more active than in the Iberian Peninsula, the land in Europe with the largest Jewish population. This course explores the history of Jewish-Christian debate and conflict in the pre-modern period. It considers the formation of the “hermeneutical Jew,” an image formed in Christian writing that depicted Jews as “bad” readers of the Bible. It will then turn to medieval engagements with these traditional images, looking at the rise of the Christian friars (“monks with a social life”) in the thirteenth century and the role of public debate in the later Middle Ages. We will read Nachmanides’s representation of the Disputation of Barcelona (1263), including the modern graphic novel based on his account. We will look at philosophical attacks by Jews and Christians on each other’s texts (Joseph Kimhi, Petrus Alfonsi, Abner of Burgos), and conclude with a discussion of the “converso” problem of fifteenth-century Iberia, in which debates raged over the place of Jewish converts in Christian society (culminating in the foundation of the Spanish Inquisition and the expulsion of Jews in 1492). This course will constitute a historical exploration of the important role of Judaism in Christian thought and the common arguments, both philosophical and literary, used by Jews throughout the Middle Ages to counter Christian attacks and resist Christian appeals to conversion and assimilation.","Szpiech, Ryan  ",JUDAIC,417,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - The Jewish-Christian Debate in Medieval Iberia and Beyond,3,,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

Topics in Judaic Studies,"What is the role of children, boys and girls, in Judaism? Although the religious education of children in the family has always been a major concern in Judaism, children are rarely presented as role models in the Hebrew Bible. Since Hellenistic-Roman times (in Second Temple Judaism and the New Testament) we can see more attention being paid to children, which led Jews (and Christians) to stress the importance of schooling and formal education even outside the family. Children however were not recognized as autonomous until the nineteenth century, when Jews and Christians in Europe and the United States got involved in the general cultural debate on children's rights, which also led to the establishment of the first youth organizations. The course will focus in particular on the ""ideal"" role that Jews attributed to children based on their reading and rereading of ancient scriptures, and on the Holocaust as a very special chapter in the experience of the Jewish child, when thousands of children in total abandonment found themselves forced to take their destiny in their own hands, in the struggle to survive, in hiding, in ghettoes or concentration camps.","

Topics in Latin American Studies,"This seminar about seventeenth- and eighteenth-century music embarks on an inclusive investigation of the
place and function of music (secular and sacred, vocal and instrumental, for court, chamber, church, and
theater) and the musical profession in an age of passionate musical expression, extravagant musical
patronage, expanding musical commerce, and increasing connectedness among cultures. We will learn how
music and musical practices emerged and were heard or exploited within processes of sociability, diplomacy,
discovery, conquest, confrontation, devotion, and religious instruction. Through intensive case studies
focused on musical centers and encounters, on the one hand, and musical repertories, on the other (likely
music of J. S. Bach, Corelli, Handel, Hidalgo, Lully, Monteverdi, Purcell, Scarlatti, Sumaya, Torrejón, Vivaldi)
we will study musical forms, conventions, and expression while engaging with lesser-known perspectives,
voices, and communities in Europe, Asia, Mexico, and Latin America. Students will learn to work with primary
musical sources of several kinds and understand some issues of performing practice. To some extent, our
focus will depend on the interests of the students enrolled in the course.","Stein, Louise K  ",LACS,455,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Early Modern Hispanic Music: la musica de dos orbes,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,

Augustan Poetry,"Horace’s Odes encompass a wide range of attitudes toward the human experience from the embrace of living in the present (carpe diem, 1.11) to sober reflection on death (puluis et umbra sumus, 4.7). At the same time, they are more narrowly concerned with the values and concerns of the culturally elite at Rome in the Age of Augustus. In this course, we will read the Odes for their breadth and specificity of reference, considering as we go the intersections of life and literature, rustic simplicity and urbane sophistication, and private concerns and public duty. Class meetings will focus on close reading of the Latin and analysis of the Odes’ poetic qualities, including meter (especially Sapphic and Alcaic strophes), with due consideration of the context in which the poems were written, both socio-historical (the rise of the principate and imperial ideology) and literary (especially the tradition of Greek lyric). At the end of the course, we will read Horace’s Carmen Saeculare, which was composed for the Ludi Saeculares of 17 BC, one of several archaic rituals that Augustus restored in order to legitimize his position as princeps. Performed as a public spectacle in a religious context, this poem offers an interesting point of comparison with the Odes, which were composed for the reading pleasure of private citizens.","Berlin,Netta",LATIN,409,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Horace's Odes,3,,,LATIN 301 or 302 or permission of instructor.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).  ,

American Immigration,"That America is a nation of immigrants is one of the most common, yet truest, of statements. In this course we will survey a vast range of the American immigrant experience: that of the Irish, Germans, Jews, Italians, Chinese, Japanese, Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Mexicans. Immigration to America can be broadly understood as consisting of four major waves:


the first one, that which consisted of Northwest Europeans who immigrated up to the mid-19th century

the second one, that which consisted of Southern and East Europeans at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th
the third one, the movement from the south to the north of Black Americans and Mexicans precipitated by the two world wars
the fourth one, from 1965 on, is still ongoing in the present, of immigrants mostly from Latin America and Asia.



At all times, our effort is to understand the immigrant past of these ethnic groups, both for what it tells us about the past as well as their present and possible future.Course Requirements:
            The requirements for this class consist of two essay exams (blue books, in class) comparing and contrasting a couple of immigrant groups along an important issue; and a final  research paper (about 20-25 pages long), both drawing from lectures and readings.
 
            In the research paper the topic is your family’s history as the immigrant social history of a particular ethnic/racial group that unfolded over the course of a number of generations.  The central question that will help guide you is whether the experience of your own family was typical or not. The paper should tell your family’s story as an immigrant family, 1) assessing the reasons for their migration to the U.S. as well as 2) the extent to which they experienced cultural and structural assimilation in America.
 
Both the exams will be in-class tests, consisting of one essay and a few short-answer questions that will draw from the lectures, the documentaries, and the discussion of the readings.

Latina/o Studies and the Humanities,"Stories of undocumented immigrants are often couched in terms of silence and invisibility, using expressions like “living in the shadows” and “under the radar.” Many Immigrant rights activists, on the other hand, resist this silence and invisibility and see storytelling as a political act that makes the humanity of the undocumented impossible to ignore. This class is about the politics and literature of visibility in narratives that reveal undocumented lives, as well as the theory of literature as a tool for social justice. The texts we will study illuminate the people and circumstances behind undocumented immigration, the policies that make documentation precarious and out of reach, and the sweeping generalizations and dehumanization behind terms like “illegal alien.”","Anderson,Sigrid Michelle",LATINOAM,311,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Literature of the Undocumented,3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Students in this course will develop their own actos or guerilla theatre skits at the end of the class and hold performances (hopefully both on campus and in a community-oriented venue) at the end of the semester.  Students do not need to choose Latina/o related issues for their political performances.  The Latina/o element of the course lies in learning the history of political theatre techniques that have been successfully employed by Latina/os in the Americas and applying these strategies for social change in newly developed performance pieces.","Lucas,Ashley Elizabeth",LATINOAM,311,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Latina/o Theatre for Social Change,3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Ecological zones as distinct as the Great Plains, Southwestern deserts, and the Pacific coast all fall into the region known today as the U.S. West. We might ask, how could it be that such divergent places would come to be conceived as a unified region? How, too, has the “West” come to hold such a critical place in the imagining of the United States' past and present? We might start to answer those questions by acknowledging that naming the region as the “West” has been only the most recent effort to understand these lands. Diverse populations, empires, and nations have at various moments thought of those same places as their “South”, their “North”, or their “East.” Whatever they called it, all of them thought of it as theirs. We will think through these shifting claims by considering diverse perspectives including Native Americans, Europeans, Latina/os, Asians, and Euro Americans as they appeared from 1200 CE to the present. Through that expansive span of time, we will learn, these plains, deserts, and mountains witnessed remarkable cross-cultural exchanges, celebrations, and great sorrows.","Mora,Anthony P",LATINOAM,311,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - History of the U.S. West,4,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Topics to be considered include the meaning of diasporas in our time, Fidel Castro and the making of the Cuban Revolution, masculinity and gay sexuality in the Revolution and Cuban diaspora, women's dreams, everyday life under communism, Afrocuban culture and religion, Jewish-Cuban revitalization, the Cuban visual arts movement, and the construction and deconstruction of exile identity.","Behar,Ruth",LATINOAM,313,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Issues in Race & Ethnicity,3,"SS, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Studies in Transnational Media,"Narcotrafficking and the U.S./Mexico border have remained at the center of political and cultural debate in the United States for over three decades. These topics have also become staples of the contemporary mediascape, from journalistic reporting to horror films and streaming content. The point of departure for this course is the documentary series The Day I Met El Chapo, which is representative of Netflix’s heavy reliance on narcotrafficking for various genres of programming. The course is intended to provide a historical and media industrial context for the recent explosion of such productions, including the creation and distribution of media between the U.S. and Latin America; narco cinema and the Mexican film industry; gender, class, race, and transnational stardom; visualizations of the U.S/Mexico border; drug trafficking narratives; the history of Latina/o media representation; the historical and contemporary immigration debate; and the digital and industrial landscape that has fostered the proliferation of narco-related content. By returning to The Day I Met El Chapo as a touchstone over the course of the semester, the course is also intended to give students the experience and skill set required to analyze a single media text from multiple perspectives.","Gunckel,Colin",LATINOAM,380,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Day I Met El Chapo,3,,,"Prior coursework in Film Television, and Media, Communications (TV), or Latino Studies.

Examining the relationships between socio-historical contexts, images, and industry discourse, we will also consider the intertwined questions of race, nation, gender, and stereotype through case studies of individual stars, from Carmen Miranda to Sofia Vergara. While analyzing representations of Latina/os in mainstream film and television, the course also considers the broad range of media through which Latina/os have represented themselves: experimental film, documentary, the alternative press, social media, and music cultures. Through this survey of cultural production, students will become versed in histories of immigration, various modes of media activism, the relation of Latina/os to conceptions of race, the diverse experiences of different national origin groups, and contemporary issues facing this population.","Gunckel,Colin",LATINOAM,381,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.

We examine their contrasting social characteristics (social class of origin, race/ethnicity, gender, legal status) that are the result of their different reasons for migration; different processes of incorporation; and different social outcomes in the U. S.  We particularly look at the various histories that led them to come to the U.S., the impact the legal system had on their processes of incorporation (as undocumented migrants vs. refugees vs. professional migrants), and the opportunities available to them in various regions of the country during the historical moment when they arrived in the U.S. ""","Pedraza,Silvia",LATINOAM,404,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,RE,,Upperclass standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.

Are some accents or pronunciations more attractive than others? 
 
Through exploring these questions, we aim to gain a better understanding of the sound systems of the world’s languages, how linguists do research, how to gather and interpret linguistic data, language attitudes, and the social implications of language variation. Students also have opportunities to explore their own interests, exercise creativity, foster critical thinking, and develop problem-solving skills.","Duanmu,San",LING,102,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Sounds of English,3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,
Start Talking: Introduction to First Language Acquisition,"One of the most remarkable properties of human development is how easily and rapidly children learn to use language. In fact, all typically developing children learn the languages they are exposed to, spoken or signed. So, what’s so special about children? How does the way that they learn compare to how adults learn language? How does human language learning compare to non-human animals?

As we explore these questions in class, we will find that they not only tell us about how language is learned, but what language is. We will discuss language learning in a variety of linguistic and cultural contexts, how children imitate and innovate as they learn, and what the “mistakes” kids make can tell us about their linguistic knowledge.

Topics covered include comparative human development, brain development, multilingualism, atypical language development, and rudimentary linguistic analysis. Skills developed include reading academic articles and analyzing child language data.","Atkinson,Emily",LING,106,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Language in a Multicultural World,"Which is more common around the world, monolingualism, bilingualism, or multilingualism? Do children who learn two languages from birth turn out to be developmentally and linguistically disadvantaged or the reverse? What kind of new languages emerge when languages and cultures come into contact? Would establishing English as the social language of the United States help to preserve English? Why do the most pessimistic estimates predict the death of 90% of the world's 6,000 languages by the end of this century? This course addresses questions about bilingualism and multilingualism, as they relate to language policies and language planning on the one hand and language contact on the other. With regard to the first topic, the course compares language policies, examines language rights, language officialization, language use in education, the development of new orthographic systems (and the ideological choices behind them), language revitalization, and death, among other issues. With regard to language contact, the course focuses on the new language varieties that emerge in bilingual and multilingual settings and their use and representation in the societal and educational spheres in which they are spoken. This course combines class lectures with group discussions based on students’ examination of specific case studies.","Baptista,Marlyse",LING,115,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Language and Human Mind,"This course introduces students to the “cognitive revolution” and its impact on the contemporary study of language. We review the shift away from seeing speech behavior or “languages” as the object of inquiry to the experimental and theoretical study of the cognitive mechanisms underlying our unique human capacity for language, the exercise of which permeates virtually every aspect of human life, including what you are now doing! In every household, all of the children, barring pathology - but none of the dogs, cats or other organisms (nor the inanimate objects!) - acquire the language spoken (or signed) by the adults. There is some biological property of humans that makes this feat possible. What do we know when we know a language, and what does it mean to say that humans have an innate capacity for language?","Brennan,Jonathan R",LING,209,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,Does not count toward the requirements for the Psychology major.,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Linguistic Analysis,"Languages are rule-governed systems. The rules that interest linguists are not prescriptive ones of the type ""don't split infinitives"" but are rather the systematic patterns that language speakers unconsciously know as part of their linguistic competence. For example, as a speaker of English you know how to order words in a sentence to convey a particular meaning and how to change that meaning with seemingly subtle changes in pitch; you can appropriately modify your speech for different social situations, and can understand and create novel sentences you've never heard before.

This course in linguistic analysis introduces students to the methods and theoretical principles used by linguists for rendering speakers' implicit knowledge of their language explicit. Drawing on data from English and many other languages of the world, we will investigate the sounds of language, how they are produced and perceived (phonetics), and how they pattern into syllables and words (phonology). We will study processes of word formation (morphology), sentence structure (syntax), and the relation between these structures and the construction of meaning (semantics). We will consider data such as errors children make when acquiring language, language games, historical reconstructions of extinct languages, instrumental measures, and experimental findings. Our goal is to understand the properties shared by all languages as well as the ways in which languages can differ from each other and change, with the broader aim of understanding the formal structure of human language — how language ""works"".Class Format:Class Format:

Sound Patterns,"This course explores two fundamental aspects of the sounds of human languages: speech sounds as physical entities (phonetics) and as part of a linguistic system (phonology). In viewing sounds as physical elements, the focus is on articulatory and acoustic descriptions: How are speech sounds made? What types of articulatory movements and configurations are used in the world's languages? What are the acoustic properties of consonants and vowels? In this part of the course, the goal is to learn to understand, describe, and transcribe many of the sounds known to occur in human languages. In addition, we shall learn to measure and analyze acoustic properties of consonants and vowels and examine how they vary in context.

In the second part of the course, the focus is on sounds as members of a particular language system, including how consonants and vowels are organized into larger units, such as syllables and feet. Phonological data from various languages are analyzed— that is, regularities or patterns are extracted from a data set and then stated within a formal phonological framework. We will also construct arguments to support the proposed analyses, and learn that phonetic factors play an important role in validating phonological analyses. Throughout the course, a major emphasis is that speech sounds are simultaneously physical and linguistic elements, and that these two aspects of sound structure are interdependent.

Introduction to Syntax,"This course will introduce you to the formal and scientific study of the syntax (sentence structure properties) of human language, as a domain of human cognition. It develops a scientific model to explain human knowledge of a language that also makes predictions about its representation in the mind. The focus here is on human language as a specific cognitive capacity restricted to humans, rather than on the individual languages (e.g. English, Arabic, Hindi) that are made possible by the existence of this capacity. For this reason, the course explores in detail many structural properties that are common across human languages. A simple example: all languages have specific strategies to ask questions that make them different from affirmative sentences (e.g. English uses special question words — ‘who’, ‘what’ and so on — as most languages do). In order to explain this and many other common properties of human language, a scientific hypothesis that has been explored in depth is that a large part of human knowledge of the language is biologically determined, and maybe innate. This is further supported by the fact that normal children effortlessly learn their native language at an amazing speed, despite the complexity of the task at hand (compare trying to learn for example Korean or Turkish as an adult, with years of language classes), and despite variation and deficiencies of the language input, they are exposed to.

However, it is also clear that there is a huge diversity among human languages, which can be illustrated only in an unfair way in this short description (e.g. only some languages change the sentence structure in a regular question: you say ‘Who do you like?’ in English, instead of ‘You like who?’, a possible word order similar to the one would find for instance in Chinese). Given this kind of diversity, which will be made clear, children need to be exposed to some minimum input of a particular language in order to be able to acquire it proficiently. Therefore, a major question that arises in the study of language and that will be an object of this course is how the hypothesis of a biological basis for human language — which offer an explanation for the common aspects among all human languages and for the striking success of the acquisition task — can be reconciled with the obvious diversity of the human language experience.","McNulty,Elaine M",LING,315,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"LING 111, 209, 210, or 212.",,May not be repeated for credit.,
Aspects of Meaning,"What do you know when you know the meaning of a word, a phrase, or a sentence? This introductory course aims to answer this question through the study of truth-conditional semantics. We will start by examining what a theory of meaning should explain and what components the theory needs in order to do so. We will then examine some technical machinery required for such a theory, such as propositional logic, sets, and functions. Then, we will refine our model of meaning step by step until it explains a subset of actual English sentences.","Keshet, Ezra  ",LING,316,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"LING 111, 209, 210, or 212.",,May not be repeated for credit.,
Language and History,"Languages enable us to record history, but languages themselves are also products of history and of prehistory. Many clues about the past are to be found in the vocabulary and structures of individual languages; the way languages are distributed in space, and how they are related to each other. At the same time, the discipline of historical linguistics has its own history, which we cannot afford to ignore if we want to approach the subject critically.","Baxter, William H",LING,317,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,LING 111 or 210.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

If I learn another language as an adult, will I ever sound like a native speaker of that language? Is there a cognitive advantage to being bilingual? We will explore issues of describing, measuring, achieving and maintaining the ability to speak more than one language, and examine societal issues such as attitudes, the role of language policies and formal education programs.","Baptista,Marlyse",LING,342,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"LING 111, 210, or 272.",,May not be repeated for credit.,

Languages of Asia," This course examines selected languages of Asia and what they can tell us about the societies that have used them: how they work, how they are distributed geographically and socially, how they are connected to each other, how (and whether) they have been written, what their status has been, and how all these things have changed in response to historical processes.

Language and Culture,"While languages and cultures have each been described as tight systems of meaningful coherence that reinforce each other, communication in social life is more slippery than that, rife with contradictions and conflicts.  People, for instance, may justify hierarchies by referring to linguistic or cultural standards even when doctors or CEOs themselves speak “ungrammatically.”   This course surveys research and reflection on language as a part of ""culture,"" drawing on literature in anthropology, linguistics, and related fields.  Included are scholars who see culture as primarily cognitive (and relative) ways of ‘knowing’, such as how people conceive of categories like space and time, or how they classify people and things.  However, language is no innocent medium, it does not passively disclose facts about a preexisting social, cultural, and cognitive world, but rather helps to actively constitute, even transform our worlds.  We will pay attention to the ways languages and cultures shape our relationships and channel our choices. We will also attend to struggles over meanings and forms and contexts, and will attend not only to grammar and to sound, but also to alphabets and to screens, to slangs and slogans, to humor and to authority, to resistance and to history, to the making of misunderstandings. We explore these issues through classic and contemporary readings, and through examples culled from across the globe.","Keane, Webb  ",LING,374,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,Sophomore standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Speech Perception,"In typical conversational interactions, humans are highly accurate perceivers of speech. We have little difficulty recognizing the sounds of speech and assigning a meaningful interpretation to sequences of speech sounds. Yet the problems we encounter in some listening situations, such as difficulties differentiating sounds in a non-native language (sometimes even after years of experience with that language), hint at the complexity of perceptual processing. The complexity is also apparent when we consider the challenges that the field of automatic speech recognition has faced over the years.

This course investigates how listeners interpret the input acoustic stream as a linguistic message. The course begins by considering the acoustic speech signal, and how the structured nature of acoustic variation informs perception. We will then turn to experimental work on speech perception that shows there is not a simple mapping between acoustic property and linguistic percept; rather, listeners process the input signal in ways that depend on their native language, the linguistic context, the social context, and much more. We will consider as well the dominant theories of speech perception and theoretical issues that have driven speech perception research for over 60 years, including the foundational question of whether speech perception differs from other types of auditory processing. A theme throughout the course is that students are introduced to the relation between theory and experimentation, and to experimental design, in this interdisciplinary field.

Introduction to Computational Linguistics,"Computational linguistics, also known as natural language processing, encompasses three distinct areas of study: (1) human language technologies, such as machine translation, information extraction, or spoken language dialogue systems; (2) computational models of language users, either human (computational psycholinguistics) or artifactual (artificial intelligence); and (3) digital linguistics, which is the use of computation in support of language documentation and linguistic research.

For all three areas of study, there is a common body of fundamentals. This class introduces those fundamentals.

Topics in Linguistics,"Verbs are central to the meaning and structure of sentences, but they make for very quirky main characters. Consider the everyday verb ""break"" which you might find in a sentence like (1), or like (2):   

 The teapot broke.
 The cat broke the teapot.   
These two sentences could describe the same event, but only one explicitly implicates the cat. Notice that the whole shape of the sentence changes between (1) and (2), such that the broken object is the subject in (1), but the object in (2). It also has been argued that there is extra ""causative"" meaning in (2) that is absent from (1). Yet the verb suspiciously looks identical (in English). This shape-shifting ability is known as ""verb alternation,"" and there many kinds of verb alternations which can be found across different unrelated languages. The alternations that a verb can participate in seem to relate to its meaning, but semantically defining the classes of verb alternations has proven challenging to pin down. In some cases, the verb's form also changes across alternations, so that it bears certain affixes in one of the alternating forms. The relationships between the verb's meaning, its form, its alternations, and the sentential contexts it is compatible with build the complex web of questions we'll be exploring in this class.   

In this class, we'll learn about the foundations of verb representations, and then explore different ways of answering the many open questions relating to verb meaning, event structure, and argument structure. We will investigate how experimental work specifically might be brought to bear on questions that have traditionally been explored through linguistic judgments and corpus work. Can behavioral or neurolinguistic experiments really tell us about verb representations, or is it impossible to separate these linguistic features from more general frequency-based processing mechanisms like prediction and surprisal? Can more quantitative and experimentally-controlled semantic judgment studies provide new insight into these questions? What experimental designs are most likely to contribute to our understanding of linguistically active verb meaning? What aspects of verb meaning are most likely to be fruitfully informed by experimental data?  

Students will have input into the topics covered, but these may include the optionality of arguments (e.g., subjects and objects), verb alternations, cross-linguistic and cross-modality variation, markedness, aspectual interpretation, verb root ontology (e.g., manner vs. result types), and the relationship between verb form/morphology and meaning.","Levinson,Lisa",LING,492,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Verbs: Theoretical and Experimental Approaches,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 18 credit(s).

Once a faculty member has agreed to serve as thesis advisor, student and advisor work closely together to identify a thesis topic of mutual interest. Students should begin this process in their junior year; especially if the thesis involves experimentation or conducting surveys, it is often necessary to spend time in the summer months organizing what needs to be done in order to complete the project on time. Ideally prior to the end of their junior year, honors students should fill out the Linguistics Thesis Declaration; students also declare an Honors Concentration in Linguistics with the College of LSA Honors Office. 

Honors theses by students graduating in Winter term commencement are due on April 1, and otherwise are due one month before the date of commencement. The thesis is read and evaluated independently by the thesis advisor and by a second reader jointly selected by the student and advisor. Students completing a double concentration may seek Linguistics honors with or without honors in their other concentration (or vice versa). Double majors who select joint honors may choose to write a single thesis under the supervision of a joint honors committee, consisting of the thesis advisors from both programs. (It is the responsibility of the student to establish the joint committee.) In this case, the advisor from the other concentration serves as the second reader.

All honors thesis submitted in a given academic year are eligible to compete for the Matt Alexander Award, awarded for the best honors thesis in Linguistics at that year's Graduates Reception during commencement weekend.",,LING,496,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,1 - 3,,"Honors, Independent",LING 495.,"F, W, Sp/Su, Su.",May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Capstone Seminar,"In typical conversational interactions, humans are highly accurate perceivers of speech. We have little difficulty recognizing the sounds of speech and assigning a meaningful interpretation to sequences of speech sounds. Yet the problems we encounter in some listening situations, such as difficulties differentiating sounds in a non-native language (sometimes even after years of experience with that language), hint at the complexity of perceptual processing. The complexity is also apparent when we consider the challenges that the field of automatic speech recognition has faced over the years.

This course investigates how listeners interpret the input acoustic stream as a linguistic message. The course begins by considering the acoustic speech signal, and how the structured nature of acoustic variation informs perception. We will then turn to experimental work on speech perception that shows there is not a simple mapping between acoustic property and linguistic percept; rather, listeners process the input signal in ways that depend on their native language, the linguistic context, the social context, and much more. We will consider as well the dominant theories of speech perception and theoretical issues that have driven speech perception research for over 60 years, including the foundational question of whether speech perception differs from other types of auditory processing. A theme throughout the course is that students are introduced to the relation between theory and experimentation, and to experimental design, in this interdisciplinary field.

Phonetics,"This course introduces students to the nature of human speech production and perception, and the nature of the acoustic signal that is transmitted from speaker to listener. The course goals are: 
 To understand fundamental principles of phonetic variation and phonetic theory. We will study the lawful but highly variable properties of speech signals; we will study as well current theories of how speakers coordinate articulatory movements to give rise to these structured signals and how listeners use the variable information to determine what speakers are saying.
  To introduce students to phonetic experimentation and modeling. Small-scale experiments will provide training in analyzing speech signals and perceptual testing, and will reinforce theoretical principles by serving as empirical tests of some influential claims.
  To consider the relation between the physical instantiation of speech and its cognitive representation. Our exploration of this issue will ideally serve as a bridge between phonetics and future coursework that many students will take in phonology.
  To provide practical experience in producing and transcribing sounds of the world's languages. ","Beddor,Patrice Speeter",LING,512,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,,,LING 313.,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Generative Syntax,"In Generative Linguistics, syntactic structure is generated by a formal rule system and by applying constraints to its output. Some of these rules and constraints have been hypothesized to be innate, or ""unlearned"" (most likely a species specific system). That is supported by how human language acquisition (or grammar growth) takes place, in a fast and successful way across the species, and by the observation of striking structural similarities across different human languages. Other aspects of our linguistic knowledge appear ""learned"", i.e. determined by an interaction between human biology and the particular linguistic experience individuals are exposed to, motivating different but constrained aspects of variation among human languages. This class explores this so-called ""Principles and Parameters"" approach to the analysis of human syntactic knowledge, focusing on the investigation of how various postulated (""simple"") rules and constraints can interact to generate (""complex"") structures, characteristic of the potentially infinite number of human language sentences one can produce (such as the one you are now reading, and understanding).","Pires, Acrisio  ",LING,515,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,LING 315 or Permission of Instructor.,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

College Writing,"Through all that has happened since 2020, the idea of “making sense” may seem like a quaint notion of yore. Certainly the events of the last year have shaken many of us out of our customary ways of sensemaking in our daily lives, in our understanding of relationships, of country and society and economy. And the word “surreal” has been used repeatedly to capture how strange the world recently began to feel—in response to the pandemic, racial justice protests, the presidential election and its aftermath, and the Capitol insurrection, to name a few prominent examples. But what does it mean to be surreal? Did things ever make sense, or had we just been deluding ourselves all along?","Beal,Scott W",LSWA,125,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Writing in the Surreal World,4,FYWR,,Participants in the Lloyd Scholars for Writing and the Arts Program.

From childhood crushes to white whales, our obsessions can be self-defining and often drive us to write/create beautiful things.

College Writing,"Zombies, vampires, werewolves, cyborgs, yetis, witches, ghosts, demons and countless others—they stalk us relentlessly from the pages of our favorite novels and stories. Their creepy images haunt us from movie and TV screens—and we love every minute of it, however frightened we might be. Plenty of these monsters are beastly, but many of the beasts we love just as much as we love monsters aren't scary at all. What, if anything, do the monsters who scare us and the beasts who charm us, have in common? Why do we fear these beastly monsters, and why do we love them? What's behind our enduring urge to create and consume narratives of these inhuman imaginary beings? Are they as inhuman as they seem—or is what captivates us about monsters the unsettling suggestions and foreboding images they offer us about who and what we really are?","Berkley,Angela Marie",LSWA,125,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004, - Monsters and Beasts,4,FYWR,,Participants in the Lloyd Scholars for Writing and the Arts Program.

A recent poll of Americans asked whether they believe that “a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media”—17% responded yes, and 37% said they didn’t know. Superstitious, magical, pseudoscientific, and conspiracy thinking all share in common ungrounded beliefs not supported in current evidence.

College Writing,"How many times have you heard someone say (or have you said), “It’s just TV!” In this class, those, as they say, are “fightin’ words.” Television—from high drama like Breaking Bad to goofy animation like Bob’s Burgers—makes meaning, makes arguments. Television both reflects and creates current attitudes about public issues; and it can and should inspire important, sometimes difficult, conversations. I’ve designed this course around one major question that should be important to those of us who love TV (or who hate it!), who live for the next episode of Riverdale or the next season of Queer Eye, or who would rather eat glass than watch Game of Thrones: How does TV make meaning?

Problem Seminar,"Background and Goals: One of the better ways to develop mathematical abilities is by solving problems using a variety of methods. Familiarity with numerous methods is a great asset to the developing student of mathematics. Methods learned in attacking a specific problem frequently find application in many other areas of mathematics. In many instances an interest in and appreciation of mathematics is better developed by solving problems than by hearing formal lectures on specific topics. This course is intended for students who are enthusiastic about doing mathematics and solving challenging problems. It is not restricted to honors students. This course is excellent preparation for the Putnam competition.

Applied Modern Algebra,"Background and Goals: One of the main goals of the course (along with every course in the algebra sequence) is to expose students to rigorous, proof-oriented mathematics. Students are required to have taken Math 217, which should provide a first exposure to this style of mathematics. A distinguishing feature of this course is that the abstract concepts are not studied in isolation. Instead, each topic is studied with the ultimate goal being a real-world application.

Introduction to Modern Algebra,"This course is designed to serve as an introduction to the methods and concepts of abstract mathematics. A typical student entering this course has substantial experience in using complex mathematical (calculus) calculations to solve physical or geometrical problems but is inexperienced at analyzing carefully the content of definitions and the logical flow of ideas which underlie and justify these calculations. Although the topics discussed here are quite distinct from those of calculus, an important goal of the course is to introduce the student to this type of analysis. Much of the reading, homework exercises, and exams consist of theorems (propositions, lemmas, etc.) and their proofs. Math 217, or equivalent, required as background.


The initial topics include ones common to every branch of mathematics: sets, functions (mappings), relations, and the common number systems (integers, rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers). These are then applied to the study of particular types of mathematical structures: groups, rings, and fields. These structures are presented as abstractions from many examples such as the common number systems together with the operations of addition or multiplication, permutations of finite and infinite sets with function composition, sets of motions of geometric figures, and polynomials. Notions such as generator, subgroup, direct product, isomorphism, and homomorphism are defined and studied.Class Format:Instruction Mode: As a DC (Distance due to COVID) course, all aspects of this course will be fully compatible with remote online learning.


Learning Mode: The weekly lectures for this course will require synchronous participation. At the beginning of class, the instructor will give mini-lectures introducing and explaining concepts; for the rest of the time, students will be split into breakout rooms for group work, with the instructor and the course assistant switching between groups to help. Attendance to the online class meetings is required for the participation component of the grade, because the group work sessions are an important learning component of the class. The mini-lectures will be recorded and made available if a student must miss the usual class time on a given day, and on those occasions, the student will be able to make up their participation grade by participating on a discussion board.

Mathematical Ecology,"

The study of ecology is the study of complex systems that are intrinsically dynamic and quantitative. Ecologists formulate mathematical models to describe this complexity; the equations that result are interesting both for their biological predictions and their mathematical form. Full analytical solution of model equations is typically impossible, yet to the mathematically prepared mind, they can yield up their secrets.

This course is intended to provide students with the tools needed to formulate and analyze ecological models. It is an overview of the major categories of models and the mathematical techniques available for their analysis.  Although the focus is on ecological dynamics, students in other disciplines will find the methods readily applicable to their own fields.Course Requirements:The course presumes mathematical maturity at the level of advanced calculus with prior exposure to ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and probability.","King, Aaron A",MATH,466,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"MATH 217, 417, or 419; MATH 256, 286, or 316; and MATH 450 or 451.",,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Introduction to Mathematical Logic,"All of the modern mathematics involves logical relationships among mathematical concepts. In this course, we focus on these relationships themselves rather than the ideas they relate.  Inevitably this leads to a study of the (formal) languages suitable for expressing mathematical ideas. The explicit goal of the course is the study of propositional and first-order logic; the implicit goal is an improved understanding of the logical structure of mathematics.  Students should have some previous experience with abstract mathematics and proofs, both because the course is largely concerned with theorems and proofs and because the formal logical concepts will be much more meaningful to a student who has already encountered these concepts informally.

The goal of this course is to introduce you to the world of topology, with emphasis placed on careful reasoning, and understanding and constructing proofs.

"Early Medieval Europe, 300-1000","Barbarian invasions! Mass conversions to monotheistic religions like Islam and Christianity! The fall of Rome! Ascetical drop-outs who criticize mainstream society from its margins! New gender roles! The dissemination of radically new technologies! People adopting more sustainable economic patterns! And of course fascinating new ways of defining otherness… All of these themes are integral to the history of early medieval Europe and receive due attention in Hist./Mems 210. In “Early Medieval Europe” we cover the social, economic, and cultural history of Europe and the Mediterranean from around AD 300 to 1000, pretty much the most exciting centuries in the historical record, and certainly the ones when the contemporary order of things (nation-states, universal religions, integrated for-profit economies) first came into being in western Eurasia.","Squatriti,Paolo",MEMS,210,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,
Italian Renaissance Art,"Italian Renaissance visual art surfaces in the news media and in contemporary culture in spectacular ways. In 2018 a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci sold on the art market for an astonishing 450 million dollars. The Piazza San Marco in Venice appears in news footage underwater, the city said to be sinking and its fragile lagoon ecosystem threatened by colossal cruise ships. In this course, we take this evidence of the enduring visibility and relevance of Italian Renaissance art as a starting point for an in-depth survey of the period of art, 1300-1550. We examine how the works of artists like Giotto, Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo came to be regarded as so important in the history of art and valuable as cultural artifacts. Why, even within the artists' lifetimes, was their art consider to signal the ""rebirth"" of painting and sculpture and what Michelangelo called ""the divine""? But we also take these celebrated practitioners off their pedestals and apply a contextual approach to the principal Renaissance monuments— Giotto's Arena Chapel, Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, Michelangelo's David, and Sistine Chapel Ceiling, among other works. Connectivity between Italy and other European and global regions is explored through the circulation of artists, works of art, artistic technologies, and materials. The assignments include a 6-7 page paper and two examinations. Attendance of the lectures and the weekly section is required.","Holmes,Megan L",MEMS,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Special Topics in Medieval and Early Modern Studies,"What does it mean to love? As both a literary genre and a system of emotion, romance has played a crucial role in answering this question across the Middle East, from the novels of late antiquity (Greek and Latin) to medieval Islamic and Christian tales of love (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, French, and Georgian), including the great books of Layli & Majnun, the 1001 Nights, and the Haft Paykar. This class offers an introduction to the romantic tradition through a close reading of some of its prominent examples, with an eye for how they construct and subvert their own ideology: even as they vaunt chastity and fidelity, normative gender roles, and licit sex (typically heterosexual marriage) as ideal virtues, they simultaneously interrogate those ideals with numerous cases of betrayal, murder, castration, gender-bending, and illicit sex (incest, adultery). The role of women in society, and their agency in shaping their stories and destinies, lies at the center of this negotiation and will be a constant focal point for us throughout the course. Although we will connect these texts with modern examples, the bulk of our readings are drawn from the pre-modern period, which will afford us a better understanding of where romantic love comes from, and a diachronic view into points of difference and similarity with its modern incarnations. In this seminar class, students will develop a framework for critically unpacking contemporary notions of love, allowing them to reconsider how such seemingly universal experiences can be conditioned by society and culture, yet also to recognize the drives, emotions, and obsessions that we may know from our personal lives in people who lived and loved centuries ago and continents away.
For each session, active participation in class discussion, with students taking turns in leadership roles, will be expected. One blog post of about 500 words will be assigned every week, and every 2--3 weeks, a written assignment of 1250-1500 words will be due. A short reflection paper will be turned in at the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to develop your skills in critical reading, writing, thinking, and analysis.","Cross,Cameron",MEMS,360,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Sin, Sex, and Desire: Romance in the Middle East",3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Special Topics,"This research seminar is a HistoryLab course that will work with the London Metropolitan Archive (LMA) to explore daily life in medieval London through last wills and testaments. Thousands of ordinary men and women wrote last wills. Will reveal a great deal about Londoners’ mobility, family life, religion, material culture, professional networks, and the different priorities of men and women. The wills we will be working with come from London’s Commissary Court and cover the dates 1484-1487; dates which cover the War of the Roses and the accession of Henry VII, the first Tudor monarch. Thus, one of the questions for the course will be how major political events register in the daily lives of people, who are not on the battlefront. Ability to travel, language, handwriting, and lack of legal knowledge all hinder access to medieval documents. A major goal of this project will be to work with the LMA to make these wills better known to scholars, genealogists, and the interested public. Most of the wills in this register are in English rather than Latin and the LMA has digitized them for our use. Members of the seminar will work in teams, learning how to read and transcribe these sources and collaborate in creating an online museum-style digital exhibit that combines qualitative, and quantitative analysis with interactive maps and reproductions of key documents.","French,Katherine L",MEMS,411,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales,"“What prevents me from telling the truth with a smile?”  Chaucer was the first great satirist in English; his poetry was humorous, experimental, even avant-garde—and devoted to telling the truth through made-up stories.  This course will focus on the Canterbury Tales, a diverse anthology of stories varying in style, genre, and fictional teller. Written during a time of extraordinary social and political upheaval at the end of the fourteenth century, this framed story collection includes both the stately Knight's Tale and the ribald Miller's Tale, stories about women both obedient and disorderly, clerics both corrupt and . . . well,  more corrupt.  Along the way, it creates a new audience in English for literature simultaneously playful and serious. We will read most of the Tales, paying attention to the work's qualities as an innovative story collection. Central questions will include: How does the Canterbury Tales address—or even create—its audience? What does its interpretative openness accomplish? What relations develop between literary style and social position? How does the language of the text create the imaginative impression of complex characters?  How does one story speak to another?  We will focus especially on narrative voices and the effects they create in their readers; audiotapes will help us hear these voices in Middle English.","Taylor,Karla T",MEMS,465,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Conflict and Comics: Reframing the Middle East,"In recent decades, comics have evolved into a powerful medium for telling stories about conflicts in the Middle East, whether through autobiographical narratives or journalistic reports. The accessibility of comics as a kind of global language enables artists to convey the heavy toll that political strife, revolution, and war takes on soldiers and civilians. This course considers the development of comics reportage and memoir through the famous examples of Joe Sacco’s Palestine (1993-1995) and Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis (2000-2001). We then explore comics concerning civil and interstate wars in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Iraq, comparing works illustrated from the perspective of Western travelers with those written by natives to the Middle East or children of refugees. We also contrast printed formats with online comics, such as the 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning “Welcome to the New World,” asking ourselves how digital platforms have reshaped comics and our reading experience.","Barzilai,Maya",MENAS,308,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Web Based Mentorship:  Learning Through Character Play,"Overview
This seminar revolves around Place Out Of Time (POOT), a web-based character-playing
simulation involving college, high school, and middle school students. You will have a
dual role in the simulation: you will play a character yourself, and you will also act as a
project leader and mentor to the younger participants.

POOT is run in cooperation with the Center for Middle Eastern and North African
Studies and the School of Education at UM-Flint. The core of the simulation is anchored
in the years 711 through 1492 and the cultures in and around what was known as Muslim
Spain, or “al-andalus.” However, the simulation draws from all periods of history and all
world cultures. The simulation revolves around a trial - different each time the simulation
is run -- based on events and people from history. While the details are everchanging,
timeless and universal themes, such as ""identity,"" ""freedom,"" and ""security,""
are the backdrop for POOT.

This class is different because you are responsible not just for your own learning, but for
the learning of younger peers who are depending on you. In order to fulfill that
responsibility, though, you will (collectively) need to understand and articulate a variety
of cultural and historical perspectives, as filtered through the personalities that appear in
the simulation. We have chosen to utilize character-playing simulation for two reasons.
First, we see great value in character playing as an exercise of the imagination. Being
forced to “walk in the shoes” of another, and to consider the ideas and the perspective of
someone from another time or place, can be a powerful catalyst to learning. Secondly,
both you and the student participants will be asked to do this character playing in a taskoriented
way. Mentors and students will learn about their character’s lives, their points of 
view, and the societal contexts in which their characters lived. You will then be
presented with a contemporary problem, which you will consider from the perspective of
your character. The idea is to help the students to construct a bridge between historical
times and the present day, to gain a heightened appreciation for other worldviews, and to wrestle with some (hopefully) interesting questions in a way that will deepen our learning
about history…and about ourselves.
It is often said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. To that, one might add
that the next best way to learn something is to play a game with it. This class tries to
combine both of those methods.","Stanzler, Jeff  ",MENAS,462,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,Experiential,,,May be repeated for credit.,
Web Based Mentorship:  Arab-Israeli Conflict Simulation,"This class is based on a computer-mediated simulation that engages middle school and high school students in exploring the Arab-Israeli Conflict through participating in it themselves. Students in high schools in Michigan, elsewhere in the US, and even outside the U.S. could be interacting with one another, and with you, over the course of the term. University student ""mentors"" (that's you) facilitate this diplomatic simulation (in which we create a scenario that becomes the ""reality"" of our world) and serve as gatekeepers, pushing the students to act in ways that are in keeping with the beliefs/constraints that the person they are portraying would hold and operate under. There is a complex structure in place for them to communicate with others, to issue press releases and otherwise express their interests and trade influence, and finally to introduce possible new actions into the simulated world. All of this is done with the support and with the assistance of the mentors.

Fundamentally, the exercise is an attempt to give students a tangible window into the diplomatic process, with it's slow, thorny inner-workings. This course, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (AIC) simulation itself, are based on the idea that the most meaningful learning often happens when one is actively engaged in a purposeful activity. By participating in AIC as a mentor, we hope that you will get a chance to think deeply about (among other things) how people learn to take diverse perspectives, what it takes to foster thoughtful discourse, and the nature of diplomacy itself.

AIC is also a project in the School of Education, and part of its purpose is to develop new ways that technology can support meaningful learning experiences with high school students. Within the context of the seminar, then, we start with a basic grounding in the history of the conflict, and then move on to figuring out how to let that grounding inform your ongoing efforts to both support and challenge the student participants.","Stanzler, Jeff  ",MENAS,463,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  ,
Advanced Topics in MENAS,"This course examines the rise and evolution of political and social movements that derive their distinctive identity from Islam by appealing to its foundational ideas and values and acting in its name and/or in the name of God. We will analyze the causes, origins, strategies, goals, and relations with state authorities of such movements in different areas of the Muslim world and in the countries in which Muslims constitute a substantial minority. After a brief introduction to Islam as a religious, cultural, and political tradition and social system, we will address the phenomenon of so-called “political Islam” in the modern age (late nineteenth century-present), its historical roots, and theological-juridical underpinnings. While the ideological premises shared by all the major Islamic movements are extremely important, we will focus on the diversity of political and social agendas of such movements in various regional contexts. The role of the political, social, and cyber environments (the Internet) in which regional Islamic movements evolve and operate will receive special attention. The course features a number of recent documentary films as well as sessions conducted by foreign and local guest speakers with expertise in different regional manifestations of Islamic/Islamist politics.","Knysh,Alexander D",MENAS,492,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Islamic Movements in Comparative Perspective,3,,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

The Bronze Age (3200–1200 BC) was an era of globalization and international trade in the Middle East. During this period, monarchs such as Hammurabi of Babylon built empires with immense armies, diplomats, and scribes at their disposal. In an unprecedented economic boom, merchant ships imported luxury goods from across the Mediterranean to supply the palace of King Tut. Then, it all fell apart. Dozens of cities were burned to the ground or abandoned, trade networks collapsed, and empires fell.","DeGrado,Jessie",MIDEAST,214,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
From Kim Kardashian to Movses Khorenatsi: Deciphering the Armenian Experience,"Kim Kardashian is an influential businesswoman and reality TV star. Movses Khorenatsi claimed to live in the 5th century and is known as Patmahayr-- the Father of History. What, then, does it mean to call them both Armenian? Is it possible to inhabit different worlds, and seemingly the same group, at the same time? Or, more simply: how might two people be Armenian (or Greek, or Persian, or Turkish, or American) differently?

This fast-paced course will test the limits of belonging -- and not belonging -- to a particular ethnic group, community, or culture. Together, by examining a wide array of cultural artifacts (painting, literature, history, film, music), students will learn to analyze the diversity of Armenian experiences over time.
Our readings will be paired to generate dialogue between unlikely figures. For instance, what might the classically trained 20th-century musicologist, Gomidas Vartabed, have to say about the alternative metal band System of a Down? How might the Armenian medieval epic, David of Sassoun, offer a different way of thinking about group affiliation than does modern-day nationalism? If Kardashian and Khorenatsi could meet, what would they say? Short, critical essays will accompany our investigations, helping us to think about the challenges or treating Armenian culture -- or any culture -- as a cohesive unit. Students can expect to gain a broad understanding of Armenian culture and history over the last two millennia, as well as to become sensitive readers of internal heterogeneity within other cultural contexts.","Pifer,Michael Bedrosian",MIDEAST,222,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
"The Historical Jesus in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam","Everybody thinks they know Jesus, but who was he, really? What did he do? Who did he claim to be? What kind of a Jew was he? How did he become the founder of a new religion? The course focuses on the Jewish religious leader and messianic claimant, and founder of the Christian movement, Jesus of Nazareth (Jesus son of Joseph, Joshua bar-Yosef, Isa), as a historical character. By examining all extant historical sources (Jewish, Christian, and Islamic), the course offers a critical reconstruction of the major stages of the life and deeds of the prophet from Nazareth, from his birth under Herod the Great to his death and crucifixion under Pontius Pilate, within the diverse world of Second Temple Judaism. In particular, the course explores the ever-changing interpretations of Jesus in modern and contemporary Christianity, Judaism, and Islam to the present.","Zurawski,Jason M",MIDEAST,238,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

How do the Sabbath laws inscribed in the Hebrew Bible relate to Jewish practices of rest and celebration in the modern period? This course familiarizes students with the central sacred texts and practices of Jewish traditions as they have been interpreted by different communities over the past 2000 years. We study the development of Jewish thought and practice through a series of different lens--theology, history, ethnography, and feminism among others. By exploring the diverse history of Jewish practice, students gain insight into contemporary debates in the Jewish world: questions such as who is a Jew, which practices define Judaism as a religion in the modern world, and what does a flourishing Jewish community look like.","Ginsburg,Elliot K",MIDEAST,276,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.
Screening Jewish Cultures,"This course explores the diversity of Jewish societies through a range of American, French, German and Israeli films, spanning the history of cinematic production. We begin with American immigrant cinema and consider how Jews negotiated the categories of race and ethnicity in films such as  The Jazz Singer,   Annie Hall,  and  A Serious Man.  Turning to Nazi cinema and post-Holocaust films produced in Germany, France, the U.S., and Israel, we interrogate the use of the medium for propaganda, documentation, and witnessing. The course also introduces students to Israel as an immigrant society and to the cinematic representation of Jewish and Arab minority groups. Throughout the course, we reflect on casting choices, language use and subtitling, cross-dressing, and genre choices, as these affect the cinematic construction of Jewishness in relationship to other social groups.","Barzilai,Maya",MIDEAST,280,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

It focuses on the spread of the Word of God (Qurʾan) in different media and settings (e.g., manuscripts and buildings), the definition of Islamic art, major monuments as well as vernacular architecture, palatial art production as well as ephemera, artists and patrons from minority communities, patronage of women, gendered spaces, soundscapes and smell escapes, interactions between China, Europe, and the Byzantine Empire, and Orientalist art and architecture.","Gologlu,Sabiha",MIDEAST,285,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
First Year Seminar in Middle East Studies,"In this first-year seminar, we both study and engage in the shared human practice of examining and making sense of one’s life and expressing and communicating life stories, in a wide range of mediums and genres. We will investigate a selection of Middle Eastern life narratives, ranging from more traditional life story genres like written memoir and autobiography, to live story-telling and spoken word pieces, to those in more visual mediums such as documentary and experimental film, graphic life narratives and comics, photographic representations and multi-media installations, vocal musical genres including Middle Eastern rap/hip-hop, as well as movement and dance (including works by and/or about Raja Shehadeh, Diana Abu Jaber, Assia Djebar, Sayyed Kashua, Ari Folman, Leila Abdul Razzaq, Sama al-Shaibi, DAM/Tamer Nafer, Shadia Mansour, Larissa Sansour, and others).","Bardenstein,Carol B",MIDEAST,295,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Connecting Life Stories, Connecting Lives: The Middle East and Beyond",3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
First Year Seminar in Middle East Studies,"Gender expression in the ancient Middle East and North Africa holds many surprises for a modern audience. Mesopotamian scribes believed that the world’s first author was a woman. In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh Hatshepsut used feminine pronouns but referred to themself as king and son—not queen or daughter. And in the temples of the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, clergy crossdressed in religious ceremonies. This class studies gender as a social construct and considers the ways in which people in the ancient Middle East maintained and contested gender roles. We will read a variety of texts, including the Epic of Gilgamesh, and survey visual evidence to consider the complex interaction between the categories of gender and sexual orientation. We will also explore how modern assumptions about patriarchy, biological sex, and the Middle East can interfere with our ability to explore the full variety of gendered experiences in the ancient world.

Conflict and Comics: Reframing the Middle East,"In recent decades, comics have evolved into a powerful medium for telling stories about conflicts in the Middle East, whether through autobiographical narratives or journalistic reports. The accessibility of comics as a kind of global language enables artists to convey the heavy toll that political strife, revolution, and war takes on soldiers and civilians. This course considers the development of comics reportage and memoir through the famous examples of Joe Sacco’s Palestine (1993-1995) and Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis (2000-2001). We then explore comics concerning civil and interstate wars in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Iraq, comparing works illustrated from the perspective of Western travelers with those written by natives to the Middle East or children of refugees. We also contrast printed formats with online comics, such as the 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning “Welcome to the New World,” asking ourselves how digital platforms have reshaped comics and our reading experience.","Barzilai,Maya",MIDEAST,308,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
"Sin, Sex, and Desire: Romance in the Middle East","What does it mean to love? As both a literary genre and a system of emotion, romance has played a crucial role in answering this question across the Middle East, from the novels of late antiquity (Greek and Latin) to medieval Islamic and Christian tales of love (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, French, and Georgian), including the great books of Layli & Majnun, the 1001 Nights, and the Haft Paykar. This class offers an introduction to the romantic tradition through a close reading of some of its prominent examples, with an eye for how they construct and subvert their own ideology: even as they vaunt chastity and fidelity, normative gender roles, and licit sex (typically heterosexual marriage) as ideal virtues, they simultaneously interrogate those ideals with numerous cases of betrayal, murder, castration, gender-bending, and illicit sex (incest, adultery). The role of women in society, and their agency in shaping their stories and destinies, lies at the center of this negotiation and will be a constant focal point for us throughout the course. Although we will connect these texts with modern examples, the bulk of our readings are drawn from the pre-modern period, which will afford us a better understanding of where romantic love comes from, and a diachronic view into points of difference and similarity with its modern incarnations. In this seminar class, students will develop a framework for critically unpacking contemporary notions of love, allowing them to reconsider how such seemingly universal experiences can be conditioned by society and culture, yet also to recognize the drives, emotions, and obsessions that we may know from our personal lives in people who lived and loved centuries ago and continents away.
For each session, active participation in class discussion, with students taking turns in leadership roles, will be expected. One blog post of about 500 words will be assigned every week, and every 2--3 weeks, a written assignment of 1250-1500 words will be due. A short reflection paper will be turned in at the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to develop your skills in critical reading, writing, thinking, and analysis.","Cross,Cameron",MIDEAST,309,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Introduction to Arab Literature in Translation,"This course explores the progression of Arabic literary culture from early sources to the present through works in English translation. Beginning with an introduction to ancient Arabia and pre-Islamic poetry, we will examine the Quran, Islam, and the literary legacy of the Caliphal periods. The discussion will also focus on The Arabian Nights as an expression of the popular culture of the times, belle-lettrist works, and those of the Arab geographers, scientists, and philosophers. New departures in Arabic literature will be examined within the context of contacts between the Arab world and the West in the modern era. Particular attention will be given to the works of Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature. Lectures and discussions, along with audio-visual materials, will reference the history of the Arabs and the cultural context disclosed in their writings. Issues relating to translation will also be discussed.","Le Gassick,Trevor",MIDEAST,325,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
The Arab-Israeli Conflict in Middle Eastern Literature and Film,"In this course, we examine the Arab-Israeli conflict as portrayed in both Arabic/Palestinian and Hebrew/Israeli literary traditions – short stories, novels, novellas, literary essays, and personal accounts – and film. We will look at how adversaries portray each other, how mutual stereotypes are created and reinforced, or broken down as the case may be, and how the conflict has shaped the development of these respective literary and filmic traditions in substantially different ways. Complementing courses that examine the Arab-Israeli conflict through political and historical lenses and approaches, this course offers the unique perspective of examining the conflict through the literature and film produced by parties to the conflict. Readings will include works by Almog Behar, Liana Badr, Orly Castel-Bloom, Emile Habiby, Ghassan Kanafani, Sayed Kashua, Etgar Keret, Sahar Khalifeh, Amos Oz, Dorit Rabinyan, Khalil Sakakini, Adaniya Shibli, Mahmoud Shukeir, A.B.

Iranian Cinema: Re/Presenting a Nation,"This seminar course is an overview of the century-long history of Iranian cinema, beginning with the first films that came out of the encounter with Europe and up to the celebrated place it holds in the world today. Our focus is on feature films made in Iran, although documentaries about Iran and films made in diaspora will also be taken into consideration. The films are contextualized with lectures and readings that highlight critical themes in modern Iranian history, including colonialism, nationalism, race and ethnicity, the performance and politics of gender, international relations, the struggle for (self-)representation, social protest, and revolution. Students who take this course can expect to gain not only a firm grasp of the major figures and movements in Iran's cinematic history, but also exposure to some major theoretical approaches within this field: formal analysis, genre, gender, and the gaze, the role of women behind and before the camera, the formation of modern subjectivity, political media work, postcolonial studies, hyphenation and hybridity, and the global frameworks of ""(inter-)national,"" ""(third-)world,"" and ""accented"" cinema","Cross,Cameron",MIDEAST,331,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
History and Religion of Second Temple Judaism,"Evil. Why does it exist? How can a good God allow bad things to happen to good people? This is the question of theodicy, a problem that has plagued philosophers, theologians, and thinkers of all sorts for thousands of years. It is a question which has spurred more religious and spiritual innovation than perhaps any other. The answers developed to deal with such a profound problem are tied to the development of, for example, monotheism, messianism, the devil, heaven and hell, and many others. In this course, we will explore a fascinating and dynamic period of Jewish history: the Persian, Hellenistic, and early Roman eras, the time from which Judaism and Christianity as we know them today will emerge. We will explore the history of the period along with its extremely diverse body of literature, many texts of which fall outside standard religious canons but which were indeed canonical to those who read and used them, texts like the Dead Sea Scrolls. In this review, we will pay particular attention to the question of theodicy and the problem of evil and how it impacted nearly every major ideological and practical development we find from this period. From this class, we will discover just how profound an effect the question of evil had not only during the Second Temple period but on culture and civilization to this very day.","Zurawski,Jason M",MIDEAST,335,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Theodicy and the Problem of Evil,3,HU,,,,May be elected three times for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.
Israeli Culture and Society,"Since its establishment in 1948 until today, the State of Israel has unsettled, constantly shifting borders. At the same time, borders are rather difficult to cross in Israel/Palestine. This course will introduce students to the diversity of Israeli society and culture through the theme of borders and border crossing. Borders, borderlines, and border crossing will be explored in diverse arenas: geo-political, ethnic, linguistic, religious, gender, economic, and the intersections between them. Students will read and analyze a wide range of literature and cultural products (film, music, art, architecture, food) by Arabs and Jews, Mizrahi and Ashkenazi, religious and secular, natives and immigrants who express and examine these complex issues in their work.","Pinsker, Shachar  ",MIDEAST,356,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Borders and Border Crossing,3,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
A Global History of the Jews of Spain,"1492 marked the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, which had been one of the most flourishing centers of the Jewish world. But the end of Jewish life in Spain did not mean the end of Spanish Jews; on the contrary, Sephardic Jews (as the Jews from the Iberian Peninsula are called) retain a distinct identity even today. This course traces the Jewish diaspora from Spain and Portugal with particular attention to how Sephardic Jews maintained ties of commerce, language, and identity across increasingly large distances. We begin with a brief overview of the history of Jews in Spain and Portugal. We then move on to examine the nature of Sephardic life in North Africa, the Middle East, Italy, Europe, and the Americas. Some questions we will explore include: how Sephardic Jews used their transnational ties to their coreligionists to advance their commercial interests; Sephardic Jewish identity as expressed through language, literature, and culture; and the unique ways in which Sephardic Jewry faced modernization. We will end the class by examining aspects of Sephardic Jews’ experience in Israel and America today, including how a number of Christians in the American Southwest are claiming a “crypto-Jewish” identity as the descendants of Marranos (Jews converted to Christianity).","Mays,Devi Elizabeth",MIDEAST,386,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,JUDAIC 205.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Humanities Topics in Middle East Studies,"In this course, we will focus on the interaction of Jews, the largest minority in the Roman Empire, with the different facets of the Roman public bathhouse, which was an impressive architectural complex. It featured both hot and cold water installations as well as a wide range of other services — a sauna and massage parlors, swimming pools, open courts for recreation and sports, gardens, meeting rooms, food and oil stands, and at times even libraries and brothels. In addition to bathing, the bathhouse embodied many cultural facets of the Roman realm and ultimately became a vital entity that encapsulated romanitas, the Roman experience of life. We will utilize a large plethora of sources — archaeological remains of architecture and sculpture, inscriptions, Greek and Latin literary sources as well as numerous Jewish sources in Hebrew and Aramaic, in order to trace the cultural dynamics in the bathhouse. On a broader level, we will study through the bathhouse the cultural exchange that took shape in the Roman East. Among others, we will discuss topics such as hygiene, self-care, health, body and body shaming, and magic.","Eliav,Yaron Z",MIDEAST,391,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Jews and Roman Culture: The Institution of the Public Bathhouse,3,HU,,At least one previous course in Middle East studies.

Humanities Topics in Middle East Studies,"What does it mean to be “black” in Jewish culture? In this course, we explore how Jewish societies have understood and engaged with Blackness and Black peoples over the ages. Delving into the parallel struggles of Blacks and Jews, we ask: How does the history of slavery intersect with the status of Jews in the Middle East? What connections can be drawn between the civil rights struggles in Israel and America? Throughout the course, we discuss the flexible and interrelated nature of the categories of Blackness and Jewishness across different historical, geographical, and temporal contexts. Themes explored include black and Jewish anti-colonial thought; Ethiopian and North African Jewish history; race and racism within the Middle East. By the end of the course, students will better understand how diasporic and racial identities are constructed and reconstructed over time and space.","Roby,Bryan Karle",MIDEAST,391,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Blackness and Jewishness: A History of Encounters,3,HU,,At least one previous course in Middle East studies.

Islamic Movements in Comparative Perspective,"This course examines the rise and evolution of political and social movements that derive their distinctive identity from Islam by appealing to its foundational ideas and values and acting in its name and/or in the name of God. We will analyze the causes, origins, strategies, goals, and relations with state authorities of such movements in different areas of the Muslim world and in the countries in which Muslims constitute a substantial minority. After a brief introduction to Islam as a religious, cultural, and political tradition and social system, we will address the phenomenon of so-called “political Islam” in the modern age (late nineteenth century-present), its historical roots, and theological-juridical underpinnings. While the ideological premises shared by all the major Islamic movements are extremely important, we will focus on the diversity of political and social agendas of such movements in various regional contexts. The role of the political, social, and cyber environments (the Internet) in which regional Islamic movements evolve and operate will receive special attention. The course features a number of recent documentary films as well as sessions conducted by foreign and local guest speakers with expertise in different regional manifestations of Islamic/Islamist politics.","Knysh,Alexander D",MIDEAST,411,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,Introductory course on Islam (i.e. NEAREAST 216).,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Islamic Intellectual History,"After examining Islam as a concept (or, rather, an array of different conceptualizations), a subject of academic inquiry, and an intellectual challenge (in terms of defining what is included into and excluded from this elastic category), we will undertake a comparative exploration of Islamic discursive theology (kalam), legal theory (fiqh), philosophy (falsafa), and modern-day Islamic reformism (islah) and “fundamentalism” (Salafism; salafiyya). We will pay special attention to the question of how these diverse fields of intellectual endeavor – varying in methodology and purpose – have conceived of God and his relationship with the world he created, especially the world of human beings. Islamic doctrines and practices have always evolved within concrete socio-political circumstances that decisively, if indirectly, shaped their evolution across time and space. Recent and current debates inside and outside the Muslim world over current and future directions of Islamic thought and practice, as well as the burning geopolitical issues faced by the global Muslim community (umma), will be discussed in detail. Last, but not least, we will evaluate the usefulness and suitability of recent Western sociological, hermeneutic, and anthropological methodologies in explaining the intellectual, ritual, and spiritual aspects of the life of the umma. We will also attempt to formulate and propose new, original ways of approaching the complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that we call “Islam.”","Knysh,Alexander D",MIDEAST,424,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,ULWR,,Taught in English.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Course Objectives
The thematical objective of this course is to promote students’ dedication to cultural diversity in the contemporary context of globalization. History serves to keep records of past events, yet more crucially, to illuminate people’s thoughts and shape their behaviors. A necessary step of cultural diversity is to know, acknowledge, and appreciate people and things beyond the realm of our life and take them as a critical reflection of the self. In this course, students can expect to learn how communications and exchanges were established between China and the Middle East, as well as how they were influenced by various global or regional factors.","Li,Xiaoyue",MIDEAST,492,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003," - China and the Middle East: Commodities, Ecology, Infrastructure",2,HU,Minicourse,At least one prior course in Near Eastern studies and/or related to the topic of the course.,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.

Topics in Middle East Studies,"What does it mean to love? As both a literary genre and a system of emotion, romance has played a crucial role in answering this question across the Middle East, from the novels of late antiquity (Greek and Latin) to medieval Islamic and Christian tales of love (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, French, and Georgian), including the great books of Layli & Majnun, the 1001 Nights, and the Haft Paykar. This class offers an introduction to the romantic tradition through a close reading of some of its prominent examples, with an eye for how they construct and subvert their own ideology: even as they vaunt chastity and fidelity, normative gender roles, and licit sex (typically heterosexual marriage) as ideal virtues, they simultaneously interrogate those ideals with numerous cases of betrayal, murder, castration, gender-bending, and illicit sex (incest, adultery). The role of women in society, and their agency in shaping their stories and destinies, lies at the center of this negotiation and will be a constant focal point for us throughout the course. Although we will connect these texts with modern examples, the bulk of our readings are drawn from the pre-modern period, which will afford us a better understanding of where romantic love comes from, and a diachronic view into points of difference and similarity with its modern incarnations. In this seminar class, students will develop a framework for critically unpacking contemporary notions of love, allowing them to reconsider how such seemingly universal experiences can be conditioned by society and culture, yet also to recognize the drives, emotions, and obsessions that we may know from our personal lives in people who lived and loved centuries ago and continents away.
For each session, active participation in class discussion, with students taking turns in leadership roles, will be expected. One blog post of about 500 words will be assigned every week, and every 2--3 weeks, a written assignment of 1250-1500 words will be due. A short reflection paper will be turned in at the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to develop your skills in critical reading, writing, thinking, and analysis.","Cross,Cameron",MIDEAST,590,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Sin, Sex, and Desire: Romance in the Middle East",3,,,Upper-level undergraduates or graduate students with previous coursework in Middle East Studies.,,May be elected three times for credit.

Themes in Native American Studies,"Feathered headdresses. Face paint. War whoops. These are markers of the stereotypical Indian in American popular culture. They are easy to see and often easy to condemn. The American public increasingly wants to know that when they see a Native American the clothing/regalia is accurate, the person wearing it is authentically Native, and the encounter is not one of appropriation. But what do we mean by accurate, authentic, and appropriation? How can we be sure of what those concepts demand of Native and non-Native people? This course focuses on one piece of the long history of Native American representation in American popular culture: authenticity and its evidence. We will read cultural productions (e.g. images, literature, film, music, plays) that depict Native Americans in order to identify how these cultural objects explain and defend a particular notion of Native American-ness. Tracking the relationship among claims to authenticity, evidence proving those claims, and assumptions about suitable evidence we will seek to recognize the underlying logic in American ideas of Indianness. We will work to dissect this logic to ascertain its foundations, reveal its instability, and uncover its insecurities. This course is suitable for Native American Studies Minors, the Ethnic Studies Sub plan, and those interested in the representation of minorities in American popular culture.

Introduction to Native American Studies,"What makes a person “native” to “America?” Is being Native American decided by race, kinship, citizenship, or place of origin? Why is there an entire field devoted to this group of people? Why do they keep showing up in Westerns and as sports mascots? Why do they care about pipelines and the Department of the Interior? This course provides a broad overview of the people, the questions, the issues, the history, and the current conversations that comprise Native American (and Indigenous) Studies. In it, we will explore the presence, persistence, complexity, and vitality of Native Americas. This course connects our location (Michigan) to our past (history of the University of Michigan) to our present (21st-century interactions with Native people and Native Studies on campus). It asks what it means to live within the context of the United States as indigenous communities with unique identities and inherent sovereignty. We will trace developments within Native American and Indigenous Studies to situate our own curiosity within the broader, global field to better understand the shape of scholarly inquiry in an Ethnic Studies paradigm. This course is suitable to those interested in a Native American Studies minor, an Ethnic Studies sub plan, or those who are curious about the relationship between Native Americans and their own lived experience.

Studies in Native American Literature,"An expression coined in 1983 by critic Kenneth Lincoln, “Native American Renaissance” refers to an American Indian literary movement that came into existence following N. Scott Momaday’s receipt of the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for his novel House Made of Dawn. Momaday was not our first successful Native American writer – Indians had been publishing in the English language fairly continuously for the previous two centuries – but he was the first to receive a major American literary award. Since literary movements and awards do not happen in a historical vacuum, we should observe that the Native American Renaissance was happening at the same time as the “Red Power” Indian civil rights movement: a highly visible, sometimes notorious, and generally militant series of occupations of public spaces by young Indian activists. Although the two movements were rather different in both form and content, this class will read the Native American Renaissance literary movement in – and just as often against – the Red Power movement. Most of the literary texts we will study are modernist novels from the nineteen-sixties and seventies; they are aesthetically ambitious, artistically brilliant, and sometimes challenging. In addition to Momaday, our authors will include Leslie Marmon Silko, James Welch, and Gerald Vizenor.","Lyons,Scott Richard",NATIVEAM,328,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
History of the U.S. West,"
 

Ecological zones as distinct as the Great Plains, Southwestern deserts, and the Pacific coast all fall into the region known today as the U.S. West. We might ask, how could it be that such divergent places would come to be conceived as a unified region? How, too, has the “West” come to hold such a critical place in the imagining of the United States' past and present? We might start to answer those questions by acknowledging that naming the region as the “West” has been only the most recent effort to understand these lands. Diverse populations, empires, and nations have at various moments thought of those same places as their “South”, their “North”, or their “East.” Whatever they called it, all of them thought of it as theirs. We will think through these shifting claims by considering diverse perspectives including Native Americans, Europeans, Latina/os, Asians, and Euro Americans as they appeared from 1200 CE to the present. Through that expansive span of time, we will learn, these plains, deserts, and mountains witnessed remarkable cross-cultural exchanges, celebrations, and great sorrows.","Mora,Anthony P",NATIVEAM,373,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Topics in Native American Studies,"The static that flickers across the screen, the hum of electronic noise beneath an audio track – these ghosts in our machines reveal the material undercurrent of media, the flurry of energy and conductivity that facilitate technological communication. This course will introduce students to a diverse group of Indigenous artists working in the Americas and elsewhere from 1960 to the present whose practices provide insight into the machine agencies that shape our shared world. Each class will focus on the history, theory and practice of different media technology, including photography, film, sound art, video and television art, and other telecommunications platforms. In addition to studying key episodes where the history of these media intersected with colonial projects or Indigenous resistance, we will analyze core theoretical positions on media studies from the fields of Indigenous futurisms, cybernetics, and the materialist discipline known as media archaeology. Along the way, we will consider such fundamental questions as: How and why do we differentiate tool from technology, a technology from the medium? What are the racialized, gendered or primitivizing implications of these distinctions? How has technologically-aided representation been weaponized against Indigenous sovereignty, and how might media become sympathetic allies? How have media’s material qualities allowed humans to expand our field of relations, and how do machines form relations through us?","Norman,David Winfield",NATIVEAM,405,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Keepers of the Fire: Media Archaeology for Colonized Lands,3,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

We will also consider how the way our minds work, independent of any motivation to be prejudiced, can lead to bias and discrimination. In addition to examining the causes of discrimination and inequality, we will examine possible paths forward to greater equality and inclusion (in organizations and in society more broadly). Throughout the course, we will examine the scientific evidence (data) supporting each theory we discuss, so that we can “check” our understanding of the problems we consider, and consider the effectiveness of solutions that have been proposed.

What price we want to pay, how much we want to be paid, who will clean the kitchen... all of these are negotiations. Yet, while we negotiate often, many of us know very little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire? A basic premise of the course is that while one needs analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, a broad array of negotiation skills is needed in order for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course will highlight the components of effective negotiation and teach students to analyze their own behavior in negotiations.

Nonprofit Organizations,"In the first half of the course, we will pose and answer questions about the nonprofit sector’s emergence in the United States; its changing relations with government and with the for-profit sector; the current state of the nonprofit sector; and its likely future. Comparative analyses of different domains of US nonprofit activity (the arts, education, philanthropy, etc.) will provide an in-depth understanding of the processes and issues that divide and structure the nonprofit sector internally. In the second half of the course, drawing on readings in the law, public policy, and business, we will develop practical knowledge of the special challenges that come with managing and working for a nonprofit organization.","Levine, Jeremy  ",ORGSTUDY,420,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Managing People and Strategic Change in Organizations,"At their core, organizations are people-driven enterprises. One of the most critical success factors for organizational leaders is the ability to successfully and efficiently implement strategically important change. Because a change of any magnitude is an inherently social process in organizations, it is vital that an organization’s human capital approach is robust and resilient to the constantly changing world in which it operates.","Sweetman,David S",ORGSTUDY,435,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Technological Innovation,"Technological innovation is a primary goal of many businesses that seek to remain competitive and of many government policies that hope to aid local industries in being innovative. But there is a great deal of variation in which kinds of firms and which kinds of regions are highly innovative: many enterprises and regions lag behind, despite the emphasis on creating and diffusing new technologies. This variation raises the central question of what conditions actually engender or inhibit innovation. Focusing on technological innovation in the business world, this course examines what firm-level characteristics make some better able to develop technologies than others, and what social and political characteristics help make some regions more innovative than others.","Samford, Steven  ",ORGSTUDY,450,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Advanced Research Team,"Crime victims are some of the most important subjects in American politics today. They serve as the emotional anchors of criminal justice policy, memorialized in legislation such as Megan’s Law and Jessica’s Law. Since the 1970s, thousands of organizations, mostly nonprofits, were founded to serve victims’ needs. Together, they have crystalized into a full-fledged victims’ rights movement. These organizations offer direct services and lobby government for policies that would aid victims. Many also lobby government for policies that penalize offenders, aligning themselves more with the punitive criminal justice system.","Levine, Jeremy  ",ORGSTUDY,490,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Politics of the Crime Victims?

Special Topics in Organizational Studies,"Data, numbers, algorithms, and analytics are transforming work and organizations, and this class will help you understand how. Drawing on both classic insights from organization theory and recent work on technologies, we’ll take a critical look at how data is changing the nature of work, what managers do, and how organizations make decisions. This is not a class that will teach you to conduct data analytics. Rather, it will help you understand how data, numbers and related technologies get used in organizational contexts. You’ll learn about auditing algorithms, why numbers are often ignored, how “neutral” data can reproduce existing inequalities, and how to use data ethically. Topics may include AI and hiring, social media and journalism, algorithmic bias, the gig economy, how data informs branding, technologies and workplace discipline, managing with metrics, numbers and policing, and data for corporate social responsibility.","Popp Berman,Elizabeth",ORGSTUDY,495,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Data, Work and Organizations",3,,,,,May be elected six times for credit.

Special Topics in Organizational Studies,"This course deals with the relations among the economy, business, and the larger society. We begin with a discussion of the differences between sociological and economic approaches to this topic, followed by samples from the classic works of Adam Smith and Karl Polanyi. We then discuss the rise of the large corporation, focusing on both economic and sociological accounts. Following this unit, we move progressively from the internal workings of the firm toward macro-level discussions of the relation between business and society. Topics covered include issues of corporate control, the social meaning of money, production and financial markets, mergers and divestitures, globalization, the role of national cultures in shaping economic behavior, the role of business in politics, and fundamental questions about the distribution of income and wealth. The class will be run as a seminar, with both interactive lecture and discussions led by students.","Mizruchi,Mark S",ORGSTUDY,495,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Economy and Society,3,,,,,May be elected six times for credit.

Special Topics in Organizational Studies,"Hardly a day goes by when organizational wrongdoing is not among the headlines—from the misuse of data and sports scandals to interpersonal behaviors such as cheating and sexual misconduct. In this course, we will address these issues, among others, as we examine wrongdoing in and by organizations. We will explore the structural and cultural conditions that increase the likelihood of misconduct, as well as the steps that organizations can take to prevent such behavior. While some misconduct discussed in the course is the result of greed or the desire to do harm, we will also consider how wrongdoing can be unintentional or a product of benign organizational practices that can be avoided. To this end, we will ask why ethical people sometimes engage in unethical behavior.","Fein,Lisa",ORGSTUDY,495,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - Organizational Wrongdoing,3,,,,,May be elected six times for credit.

Introduction to Ethics,"Moral judgments are pervasive in our lives, and this course offers the first steps to
rigorous reflection about the nature of morality and about the principles that guide such
judgments. Critical reflection about our moral judgments leads us to ask about what kind
of feature we are ascribing to an act or outcome when we judge it to be wrong or bad. We
may also find that our moral intuitions about particular cases come into conflict with our
moral intuitions about other cases, or with moral principles we endorse. The central aim
of this course is to help students reconsider and clarify both their moral judgments and
their views about the nature of morality in light of a variety of competing ethical theories,
as well as the most trenchant arguments for and against those theories. We will also
consider how competing ethical theories apply to specific kinds of acts in our lives. For
example: Is it wrong to refrain from acting to alleviate poverty? Is it wrong to eat meat?
Do we have any moral responsibilities towards future people? ","Edmonds,Anna Kathleen",PHIL,110,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Critical Reasoning,"Reason better when deciding what to believe, and when deciding what to do. This course provides the tools you need, drawing from several areas: cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, logic, probability, and decision theory. We will consider empirical evidence about 'heuristics and biases’—spontaneous judgments that can be predictably irrational. And we will study what good deductive, causal, and probabilistic reasoning looks like. But the goal is entirely practical: to develop effective reasoning skills with clear applications in your personal and professional lives. Here are some questions we will examine:

What kinds of mental processes are involved in reasoning?
What’s the difference between intelligence and rationality? 
How do people tend to go wrong when they reason about probabilities?
What makes a line of reasoning valid or strong? 
When can we infer causation from correlation?
Why do people tend to become more certain of the views they started with? 
Are there strategies we can use to avoid common errors in reasoning?
What is evidence, and how does it interact with our background knowledge?
Why is there no simple recipe for the scientific method?
How does our initial reaction to potential risk tend to be irrational?","Edmonds,Anna Kathleen",PHIL,183,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

First Year Seminar,"This course is inspired by my growing realization of the important role that analogies play in political and moral disagreements.  Which similarities (and differences) are relevant when it comes to making policy, interpreting the law, or determining how one is permitted to act?  The ability to distinguish the fruitful, informative analogies from the misleading, and even dangerous, analogies is an ability we all need if we are to reach reasonable/thoughtful conclusions about many of the most important issues that confront us as individuals and as a group – and if, in particular, we are to avoid being manipulated by people who want us to make certain comparisons and avoid making others.  (Is the requirement to wear masks in public places more like the requirement to drive no faster than 65 mph?  The prohibition against smoking in a restaurant?  The prohibition against wearing a hijab?  The prohibition against wearing a political button?  Or ???)
In order to develop the ability to draw analogies and to sort the more significant similarities from the less significant, students in this seminar will explore a range of moral issues that philosophers and others have tried to illuminate by appealing to certain similarities and differences.  We will compare different scenarios in which one person refrains from helping another; and different scenarios that, like the case of unwanted pregnancy, involve the dependence of one person on another person’s body.  We will compare killing in self-defense with killing in war, and taxation, and forced labor.  We will ask how helping someone to die when she has a terminal illness differs morally from other cases of assisted suicide, and how is determined by one’s character or desires is similar to/different from having one’s brain manipulated by mad scientists -- or by powerful rhetoric.  In examining these discussions, we will gain a deeper insight into the issues themselves.  But we will also develop the skills necessary to better understand our own views and the views of others.  We will learn how to identify the source of our disagreements, and to think about how we might try to persuade one another to see the power of alternative analogies (and disanalogies).","Buss, Sarah  ",PHIL,196,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Morality & Politics of Analogies,3,HU,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Buddhism,"Over the course of its long history, Buddhism has been the most influential and widely practiced religion in Asia. Beginning in India 2500 years ago, it eventually spread to China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, and Mongolia, and to Sri Lanka and throughout Southeast Asia.  More recently it has spread to Europe, the Americas, and Australia. This course is an introduction to the major themes in Buddhist thought and practice. Beginning with the teachings associated with the historical Buddha, the course will go on to consider the development of the tradition over its long history in India.

Changing the World,"We tend to lead with our hearts when trying to do good. This means we focus on causes that are familiar and local, without thinking very hard about their relative moral importance, or how we could have the greatest possible impact.

Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion,"This course will introduce students to some of the major philosophical and religious teachings from Asia that have existed from ancient times to the present. Representative material will be drawn especially from Indian (Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Sufi, Sikh), Chinese (Daoist, Confucian, Buddhist), and Japanese (Zen, Shinto) schools of thought. Readings will consist largely of primary materials translated into English. The main focus of the course will be to highlight the central philosophical concepts and to ask how these ideas contribute to their respective world-views and ethical outlooks, and how they affect the religious expressions of these cultures. Asian 220 will give you the tools to think critically about the diversity of philosophical and religious traditions and ideas that exist in Asia. Students will also gain an understanding of how these philosophical ideas have been influential in shaping the religious cultures of much of Asia. The course also serves as a general introduction to philosophical thinking on a number of profound philosophical questions. What is the nature of the self? What is really real? What happens after death? What is the relationship between the individual and society? The course also aims to develop the student’s skills in reading, writing, and critical thinking.","Mandair,Arvind-Pal Singh",PHIL,262,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Chinese Philosophy,"This course will provide a survey of philosophical ideas of major figures and works of classical China, including Kongzi (Confucius), Laozi (Lao-tzu), and Sunzi (Sun-tzu). Students will deal with a wide variety of interrelated issues, such as conceptions of authority, skepticism, social equality, commitment to, or rejection of morality, etc. Some of the questions students will try to answer include:Is there a way of life that is best for humans or are we each unique in our needs and preferences? Should we try to improve the world or find contentment in all things as they are? What is the price of activism, and what is the price of apathy?","Ozbey,Sonya",PHIL,263,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Introduction to Symbolic Logic,"Logic aims to clarify principles of good reasoning in a range of areas: ordinary day-to-day reasoning as well as more abstract investigations in mathematics and the physical sciences. A basic guiding idea is an idea that logically good reasoning is 'truth-preserving. ('Truth-preserving' reasoning cannot fail to take you from true premises to true conclusions. If the premises of truth-preserving reasoning are true, the conclusions must be as well.) So one goal we have in the study of logic is to get a grip on which forms of argument are truth-preserving and which are not. Another guiding idea is that the steps of a good argument should be “simple”, or “obvious”, or “clear”; so another goal will be to get an informative analysis of what it is for a step in an argument to be “simple”, or “obvious”, or “clear”.","Belot,Gordon",PHIL,303,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, MSA, QR/1",,,"F, W, Sp.",May not be repeated for credit.,
The Scientific Revolution,"

This course focuses on the “Scientific Revolution”, a crucial period in intellectual history. The first part of the course concerns the introduction of Copernican astronomy and the subsequent dispute over this heliocentric view that culminated in the trial and condemnation of Galileo in 1633. This part of the course will include the role-playing game, “The Trial of Galileo: Aristotelianism, the ‘New Cosmology’, and the Catholic Church, 1616-1633”, which is part of the “Reacting to the Past” series. Students will play the role of historical individuals involved in the so-called “Galileo Affair”, thereby coming to appreciate “from the inside” the various philosophical, theological, and political factors involved in this pivotal historical event. The second part of the course concerns the development after Galileo of a new physics that came to be known as the “mechanical philosophy”. The focus here will be on Descartes, Leibniz, and Newton (along with Newton’s defender, Clarke). The goal is to understand the transition during this important period from cosmology and physics-based on the views of the ancients to a more “modern” outlook in these disciplines.Course Requirements:Assignments will be submitted through Canvas during a designated time","Schmaltz,Tad M",PHIL,323,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Minds and Machines,"This course will discuss minds, machines, the relationships between them, and the relationships they encourage and discourage. Throughout we will compare and contrast human minds and brains with machine ‘minds’ and ‘brains,’ considering questions like: Could a machine have a mind? Could a machine be conscious, or think in the ways that people do? What can human brains teach us about how a thinking machine might work, and vice versa? What might information processing, information integration, and information availability have to do with consciousness? Could the internet be conscious? How could we tell? How do machines and our interactions with them influence how humans think, learn, reason, and know? What are the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, big data, and gargantuan networks, especially when the underlying mechanics of machine and network reasoning are not transparent to us? How should machines be treated—including machines that exhibit some but not all features of human minds? Why? How should machines treat us?","Swanson, Eric  ",PHIL,340,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Language and Mind,"Philosophy 345 aims to provide students with a broad overview of some of the main problems in the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind. In the philosophy of language, we will focus on the theory of reference (naming) and its relation to questions about belief and modality. In the philosophy of mind, we discuss physicalism, dualism, behaviorism, the identity theory, functionalist accounts of the mind, the question of machine intelligence, and the problem of explaining conscious experience. A second, equally important, goal of the course is to help students develop their skills at careful reading, critical reasoning, and argumentative writing.","Lormand, Eric  ",PHIL,345,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Contemporary Moral Problems,"The course will explore the simultaneous elaboration of the concept of race, and of European racism, with that of human rights, proposed as equal and universal to all. This evident tension, if not contradiction between Europe that elaborates concepts of human rights, and the Europe that brings into being the most egregious concepts of race, happens thanks to colonialism and Europe's commitment to empire, and also the history of European nationalism. And so, the course will begin historically, with that.","Herwitz,Daniel Alan",PHIL,355,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Issues in Bioethics,"Many different issues fall under the heading “bioethics”: What is the proper doctor-patient relationship? Are (most/some) abortions morally permissible? Should euthanasia be legal? How is it appropriate to allocate scarce medical resources (e.g. PPE)? What sorts of constraints on individual choice should governments be permitted to impose? (Should they be permitted to forbid the sale of organs? surrogacy contracts?  group gatherings in a pandemic?) Should people be permitted (and even encouraged) to use biomedical technologies to control their own characteristics, or those of their children? In attempting to answer these questions, we confront many others. We are forced, for example, to consider the nature and value of autonomy, the distinction between sickness and health, the obligation to refrain from harming others and to help those in need. Students taking this class will be encouraged to think through these issues (and many others) for themselves, while engaging with a wide range of philosophical opinions.","Buss, Sarah  ",PHIL,356,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,No prerequisites; one philosophy introduction is recommended.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Ethics,"One of the most important questions one can ask is the central question of ethics: How should I live my life? Thinking about this question immediately leads to a whole host of other questions: Are there objective facts about how I should live? Or is ethics just a matter of opinion? And if there are objective truths in ethics, then what are they? What is a good life for a human being? How are we obligated to treat others? And what should we do when our good conflicts with the good of others? For instance, are we obligated to help those who are in poverty? And do we have any moral obligations to non-humans, such as animals?


Our goal in this class is not just to discover how philosophers have answered these questions, but to think about how we should answer these questions for ourselves. This means learning how to reason well about the deepest issues of morality.","Lowe, Dan  ",PHIL,361,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Political Philosophy,"We all want to live in a just society, but what does a just society actually look like? In this course we will examine a number of theories of what makes a society just. We will dive deeply into John Stuart Mill’s utilitarian theory of justice, Robert Nozick’s libertarian theory, John Rawls’s liberal egalitarian theory, and Karl Marx’s socialist theory. Along the way we will talk about a number of pressing issues: Do paternalistic laws violate people’s rights? Does the state have an obligation to provide health care to its citizens? Does capitalism necessarily exploit workers? All of these debates have roots in rival conceptions of a just society.


Our goal in this class is not just to discover how philosophers have answered these questions, but to think about how we should answer these questions for ourselves. This means learning how to reason well about the political ideals which have shaped the world, and continue to shape our lives today.","Lowe, Dan  ",PHIL,366,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Undergraduate Honors Seminar,"PHIL 401 is open to seniors who are declared Honors concentrators in Philosophy, and to others by permission of the instructor. The seminar functions as an intensive workshop designed to help students identify and begin an independent philosophical research project. The seminar will provide advice, discussion, feedback, and support to enable students to enter the Winter Term in a good position to write a successful Honors Thesis. The seminar begins with several weeks of general discussion about research methods and basic methodological questions in philosophy, and then enters a sequence of stages in which students are asked to write a prospectus, a critical literature survey, a proto-chapter, and to give in-class presentations of work in progress.

Aristotle,"It is often said that Aristotle's philosophy is profoundly influenced by his lifelong interest in biology. The paradigmatic substances for Aristotle, unlike Plato, are individual living organisms, substances that are born, grow, reproduce, and eventually die. The ways in which their organs and body parts subserve their needs and functions in an integrated way provides a model for understanding the relation between form and matter in general. It is here above all that we would expect his theory of scientific explanation, and the logic and metaphysics that lies behind it, to apply most fully and successfully.","Caston,Victor",PHIL,406,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Mathematical Logic,"This course is meant to be a second course in symbolic logic, intended to provide a foundation for understanding current research in philosophical logic and related areas of cognitive science. I will devote some time to review of basic techniques of formalization, in propositional logic and first-order predicate logic, but it will be assumed that students are familiar with this from an introductory course such as Phil 303. The course will concentrate on the theory of logic and computation, and will cover the following topics:
The nature of algorithms; some models of computation; basic limitative results
Proof techniques and proof theory
Models and validity
Semantic completeness of propositional and quantificational logic; Löwenheim-Skolem theorem
Incompleteness of formal arithmetic and undecidability of first-order logic; Gödel's second theorem on the unprovability of consistency.","Tappenden,James P",PHIL,414,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"BS, QR/1",,One PHIL or MATH course.,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,
Social Philosophy,"This class will explore Black and Indigenous feminist reconstructions of world contexts for social and political strategies and tactics. Worldbuilding is a staple, philosophical activity. When considering agendas towards social and political issues, it is common to attempt problem reconstruction. Less commonly appreciated, in the academy, is world reconstruction. This class introduces and explores world building for collective agendas towards a greater capacity for 1) cross-cultural philosophy, 2) more meaningful engagement with Black feminisms and Indigenous feminisms and 3) greater familiarity with the roles played by world-building in projecting social and political action.

Foundations of Rational Choice Theory,"

PHIL 443 is devoted to foundational issues that arise within the theories of rational choice that underlie the treatments of decision-making found in economics, politics, and the other social sciences. The course will investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the standard expected utility model, and explore alternatives. While the main focus will be individual decisions, some aspects of game theory may be covered. Topics to be discussed include: 

  the concept of choice
  rational preference and the notion of utility
  the “Dutch book” theorem and subjective probability
  the effects of risk or ambiguity aversion on choices
  the role of cause-and-effect reasoning in decisions
  time discounting of goods
  the role of emotional and subconscious processes in choices
  the interpretation of empirical studies of decision making
  the scope and normative standing of the economic theory of rationality. 

Readings will be drawn from the literature in economics, psychology, statistics and political science, as well as philosophy.Course Requirements:Four problem sets, one 8-10 page argumentative paper, a midterm, and a cumulative final examIntended Audience:Should be interesting and accessible to upper class students from economics, psychology, statistics, political science, philosophy, PPE, and cognitive science, as well as those from sociology, business, and computer science.

Interpreting the Zhuangzi,"The course focuses on one of the principal classics of ancient Chinese philosophy, the Zhuangzi (aka the Chuang-Tzu). Written in a humorous style, filled with fables, inside jokes, and metaphors, the work later came to be considered as one of the foundational texts of Daoism. Despite its jocular style of writing, the work touches on themes that are fundamental to the human condition, such as the distinction between “good” and “bad,” human and non-human, and life and death. As different characters grapple with these questions, they also simultaneously reflect on the most crucial question of all: how to live with joy in a world that is full of adversity. Although the focus of the course is the Zhuangzi itself, we will also contextualize the text within the broader classical Chinese philosophical tradition. Given that so much of what goes by the name ""classical Chinese philosophy"" is actively engaged in political discourse, this intertextual approach will also allow us to reflect on the extent to which many of the tales in the Zhuangzi could also be read as political satire.","Ozbey,Sonya",PHIL,456,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Philosophy of Mind,"

Distinguish the questions:
Is a scientific explanation of consciousness possible?
In what broad direction does a correct account lie?
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Most philosophical writing on consciousness over the last 30 years has patiently addressed (1) and (2), and if anything answered “of course not” to (3). By contrast in this seminar, we’ll assess a handful of less-patient theories of conscious experience that have some claim to being nearly complete. These include theories centered around cognitive influence (Dennett), higher-order thoughts (Carruthers), inner perceptions (Lycan), first-order perceptions (Tye), and panpsychism (Chalmers).
Such theories have implications for the broader choice-points for (2)—physicalism, representationalism, and so on. They also need to incorporate or at least assume responses to the doubts about (1)—the explanatory gap, zombies, Mary, and so on. And they have different implications for animals, babies, computers, and drug-altered states of consciousness. We'll follow out these threads but focus on the comparative (de)merits of the whole proto-scientific packages.
I'll rig up my own carnival milk-bottle pyramid—(1) yep, (2) step right this way, and (3) we're already there—and you please bring your own hardballs to knock it down.Course Requirements:All testing will be asynchronous, short essays or answers submitted by email.","Lormand, Eric  ",PHIL,482,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,ULWR,,"PHIL 345, 381, or 383.",,May not be repeated for credit.,

Fundamental Physics for the Life Sciences I,"Have you ever wondered how physics is important and useful in the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine? BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 150 is a new introductory physics course that will reveal the synergy between these fields and explore fundamental physics principles that are ubiquitous in the life sciences. Biology, chemistry, and medicine will provide our guiding motivation and context for exploring first-semester physics topics including energy, mechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics. These topics will be covered in the depth and manner in which they appear on the MCAT and in life science courses. In line with this, students will also learn to use quantitative reasoning, develop mathematical models, and engage in scientific dialogue with a diverse group of future scientists and healthcare professionals. This course examines physical concepts through biological examples and consists of both interactive lectures and studio meetings to facilitate student learning and enhance student performance. Lectures will encourage student participation through a variety of in-class activities in which students work directly with, discuss, and respond to lecture material and demonstrations. During studio meetings, students will gain hands-on experience solving problems in small groups, facilitated by an instructor and peer learning assistants.","Lubensky,David K",PHYSICS,150,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS, QR/1",,"MATH 115, 120, 185, or 295; knowledge of differential and integral calculus minimally at the level of MATH 115, or its high school equivalent, will be needed.

"The Physical Universe: An Introduction to Modern Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology","This course divides the cosmos into four scales of astrophysical inquiry  —  the whole universe, galaxies, stars, and planets. In addition to providing windows to view the operations of nature, each of these astronomical entities experience life cycles, beginning with a birth event and ending with death-like closure. This course shows how this cosmic evolution is driven by the basic laws of physics. 

All parts of this course will be guided by the scientific method, and will emphasize how the key concepts have been experimentally verified, the degree of uncertainty in the current measurements, and what types of changes (both large and small) might be expected with future observations. The course will teach the students that physics not only increases our understanding and appreciation of the universe, but will also show how past advances in physics have led to useful/practical technologies.Course Requirements:The course will require reading assignments, participation in lecture/discussion, homework assignments, and exams. More specifically, reading will be assigned before each class meeting, which will consist of a one-hour lecture and a half-hour discussion period (the class meets twice a week for 1.5 hours per meeting). The course will also have (approximately) weekly homework assignments that are based on the reading and lecture. These assignments will consist of straightforward physics problems that follow the course material. The course will also have both a midterm exam and a final exam. 
The proposed weighting for the grades are as follows: 

 Homework assignments (35 percent) 
 Midterm Exam (30 percent) 
 Final Exam (35 percent) 
Intended Audience:Undergraduate students at all levels of their academic career. 
Class Format:The class will consist of a one hour lecture and a half hour discussion period (the class meets twice a week for 1.5 hours per meeting).

First Lab Policy:
Attendance for the first lab is mandatory. If you have an extenuating circumstance, you must communicate with your lab instructor prior to the start of the first lab. Students who do not attend the first lab without contacting the lab instructor in advance will be dropped from their section.
Make-Up Lab Policy:
Lab attendance is mandatory. Make-ups are given only in rare cases for specific, documented reasons. These include medical reasons, family emergencies, religious holidays, and official University of Michigan sponsored events.

Fundamental Physics for the Life Sciences II,"Have you ever wondered how physics is important and useful in the fields of biology chemistry, and medicine? BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 250 is a new introductory physics course that will reveal the synergy between these fields and explore fundamental physics principles that are ubiquitous in the life sciences. Biology, chemistry, and medicine will provide our guiding motivation and context for exploring first-semester physics topics including energy, mechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics. These topics will be covered in the depth and manner in which they appear on the MCAT and in life science courses. In line with this, students will also learn to use quantitative reasoning, develop mathematical models, and engage in scientific dialogue with a diverse group of future scientists and healthcare professionals. This course examines physical concepts through biological examples and consists of both interactive lectures and studio meetings to facilitate student learning and enhance student performance. Lectures will encourage student participation through a variety of in-class activities in which students work directly with, discuss, and respond to lecture material and demonstrations. During studio meetings, students will gain hands-on experience solving physics problems in small groups, facilitated by an instructor and peer learning assistants.","Chaney,Andrea",PHYSICS,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS, QR/1",,"PHYSICS 135 or BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 150.

Introduction to Human Physiology,"An introductory course designed to acquaint students with the principles of human body function. Topics discussed include cell structure, function, and chemical composition and the functions of nerves, muscles, the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive tract, endocrine glands, brain, and reproductive organs. Emphasis is placed upon the mechanisms by which cells and organs perform their functions and the interaction of the various organs in maintaining total body function. Four one-hour lectures and one hour discussion each week.

PHYSIOL 201 is intended to meet the needs and expectations of many types of students: those preparing for careers as doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and biology teachers; those who are interested in a systematic investigation of the biological sciences; and those who desire a general knowledge of physiology as part of a liberal arts education. Students must have at least sophomore standing or permission of instructor.

Chemistry Background for Introductory Physiology Courses. Although college chemistry is not a course prerequisite, approximately 80% of the students electing PHYSIOL 201 have had some college or high school chemistry. A background in chemistry is helpful for a basic understanding of physiology since physiology represents an attempt to explain how the body functions in terms of physical and chemical processes. Students who have had no chemistry or whose high school chemistry background is weak should not be discouraged from electing PHYSIOL 201. However, such students are encouraged to obtain the textbook prior to the start of the course and study the review chapter covering basic chemistry. While it is not necessary to master all the material contained in the review chapter, a general review of basic chemistry prior to the beginning of the term usually proves helpful.","Rust,Elizabeth McLaurine",PHYSIOL,201,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,BS,,Students must have at least sophomore standing.

Rock Poetry and Political Protest in Poland,"


This course provides an introduction to Polish culture in the larger context of Slavic and Central European cultures through a detailed study and analysis of “music of protest” (jazz, cabaret, rock, punk) during the 1945-1989 period of Soviet dominance and during the period of transition to democracy and after the establishment of full democratic rule in Poland. This course also provides an introduction to rhetoric and contextual reading of poetry (as well as other forms of expression). We will study in detail texts by some of the most important Polish and other Central European pop, jazz, cabaret, rock, and punk authors and bands with the purpose of identifying devices and strategies used to create meanings. We will connect texts with elements of the daily lives of people in Poland (as well as other Central European nations) focusing in particular on: cultural heritage, history, politics, social issues, past and future myths (interpretations of past events and projections of perceived “national goals” into the future). We will study and discuss the “romantic pose” of rock poets (poet as a prophet —  the 19th-century concept created by Polish Romantic poets in the context of constructing art as an instrument of the Polish “battle for freedom and independence”). Specifically, we will investigate the “Polish trend” to build poetic texts on the foundation of ideas (rock poetry as an extension of discourse on ideas). We will compare Polish rock poetry to British and American rock poetry to highlight the dominance of “word and meaning” in Polish rock and punk of the 1980s and 2000s. Other topics will include: 

 totalitarian structures and poetic response to totalitarian structures, 
 the three taboos in Polish culture (communism, Catholicism, anti-communist opposition), 
 the quest for utopia,  
the “apologetic nature” of Polish art,  
the fear of and desire for diversity in Polish culture and history, 
 the construction of a “collective Polish psyche”.

 This course addresses a wide range of issues related to the study of history, literature, culture, social and cultural transformations, construction and deconstruction of national, social, and gender mythologies and perceptions. It will focus on responses to the imposition of totalitarian structures and survival within them, responses to historical changes, as well as strategies for constructing national consensus and for dealing with a diversity of ideas and attitudes. 

This course will focus on Polish culture but will do so in a global context: it will introduce the students to general and foundational concepts and ideas in communication, semiotics, rhetoric, and the reading of poetic texts. The focus on comprehension of complex synthetic art forms in a social, historical, and political context can be applied to other cultures as well (Polish, Slavic, non-Slavic, past, and contemporary). Polish culture will be analyzed in terms of its main building blocks: ethnicity, religion, gender, cultural identity, the importance of ideas and verbal communication, the opposition between the West and the East, the opposition between Enlightenment and Romanticism, opposition between faith and fact, the opposition between real and perceived continuity of history and culture. In the process, Polish culture will be defined in all its distinctiveness but with clear attention to the qualities shared with the cultures of other Slavic and Central European nations and states. Students will analyze how literary and non-literary texts (verbal and non-verbal) are constructed, how meanings are created and transmitted, how real and perceived connections between the author and the audience are developed.

  This will allow students to enhance their talents for persuasive and expository presentations and allow them to become “intentional” communicators and receivers of communication. Students will be exposed to the full range of human experiences in the face of war, human rights abuses, totalitarian rule, revolution, and political, social, and cultural transformation.Course Requirements:
Attendance; 
Regular short participation tests; 
Final exam. 
1 argumentative paper (8-12 pages). 
1 research paper (8-12 pages).

Introduction to Political Theory,"This course serves as an introduction to political theory, one of the subfields of political science. Political theory traditionally focuses on questions of how to manage our lives together. It concerns itself with questions of how we should live, as individuals and communities, what counts as valuable human life, what justice is, what just and fair institutions look like, and how to govern. The political theory also explores the (sometimes changing) meanings of “democracy,” “liberalism,” and “conservatism.""

This course is organized around a set of problems human communities have faced, and questions we face in the early twenty-first century: how to understand ourselves and our institutions, how to cooperate and govern, how to share resources, and how to understand our disagreements. 

This course is in the Political Theory subfield. Intended Audience:The class is designed for political science majors and non-majors. It assumes no prior knowledge of political theory or United States history.Class Format:This course will be taught with a blend of asynchronous remote and synchronous in-person elements, all of which are required.

Introduction to World Politics,"This course provides an introduction to the analysis of world politics. It focuses on theories used to explain international and domestic politics central to world politics in its full generality.  The evidence for such theories lies in patterns of behavior over time, although extensive examples and cases will be presented both to illuminate the concepts of the theories and to help the student see how theories try to explain individual events.

The course begins with an introduction to world politics.  Six principles focus our attention on the key things we need to know to understand why events happen in world politics. The first part of the course presents and explains these six principles.  The second third uses these principles to explain why war occurs, how states prepare for the possibility of war, and the consequences of war afterward.  The final third of the course addresses issues in the international political economy and other issues.  Specific issues of trade, monetary affairs, finance, the environment, and human rights are covered in this third.  The course ends by examining why the state system dominates world politics.

American Political Thought: Early,"This course covers approximately 230 years of American Political Thought.
We explore the early Protestant tradition in New England. This tradition emphasized faith,
community, small group participation, and self-government while retaining traditional ideas
about hierarchy, race, gender, and the right to exclude dissenters. Next, we look at how the
Enlightenment took hold in the colonies and the emergence of political debates on
independence, rationality, liberty, equality, consent, and limited government. We pay
particular attention to the liberal and republican traditions and how they shaped the
constitution of 1787. We delve into a range of intellectual and popular movements such as the
Great Awakening, the rise of print culture, and Transcendentalism. We look at movements that
emerge among women, such as women ’s mobilization against slavery and women’s arguments
for their own full political rights, including the right to vote. We will explore the impact of
settler colonialism, the status of enslaved people, free blacks, and Native Americans, as well as
the political and economic claims advanced by people of color. We wrap up with a look at the
ideological, economic, and political conflicts that shaped the US Civil War.

The Politics of Civil Liberties and Civil Rights,"This course focuses on landmark civil rights decisions of the Supreme Court, which elaborate the constitutional doctrine of “equal protection” and are a lens through which we can view America’s unfolding struggle over race. Situated at the nexus of law, politics, and history, the course explores the links between civil rights decisions and wider social, political, and economic contexts. Organized roughly chronologically, the course covers the following major topics: the political crisis over slavery; the law and politics of Reconstruction; the Jim Crow era; the legal construction of “whiteness” in the law of naturalized citizenship; the Japanese-American internment during World War II; “war on terror” cases involving the Guantanamo Bay detainees; and the Trump Administration’s Travel Ban. The course also includes a unit on the law and politics of the Civil Rights Era, which covers the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. The overall goal of the course is to explore the nature of Supreme Court decision-making, the relationship of the Court to the other branches of government and, generally, the role of the Supreme Court in American politics. Themes running throughout the course include “equality” as a contested concept, race and ethnic politics, and constructions of American identity.

State and Market in Contemporary China,"Market reforms since 1979 have transformed the Chinese economy and society dramatically, triggering profound consequences for China and the world. Once a deeply impoverished communist country, China is today the world’s second largest economy (by some estimates, it has surpassed the U.S. to become the world’s largest economy). Yet even as China approximates middle-income status, its challenges of governance run deep and wide. This course provides an introduction to the political economy of China’s reforms. We will review the timeline of China’s reforms, highlighting the strategies and problems that define distinct phases of development. We will pay particular attention to the role of the state in the reform process, especially that of local governments. A third area of emphasis is corruption, its patterns and relation to economic growth.","Ang,Yuen Yuen",POLSCI,337,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004,,4,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
How to be an Autocrat,"Autocrats are in a precarious position. They face threats from the population who want greater democratization and threats from other regime elites who want to replace them. How do autocrats navigate these threats? In this course, we study how to be an autocrat. After understanding the different nature of threats that autocrats face, we then move into the different ways that autocrats design their regimes to temper these threats including coup-proofing their security apparatus, discriminate and indiscriminate violence against the population, and co-optation. The last big theme is how authoritarian regimes are held accountable for their actions.","Hassan,Mai",POLSCI,352,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

History of European Integration,"The construction of the European Union has been one of the most exciting and controversial political experiments of the post-WWII world. This course aims to introduce students from a variety of humanistic and social scientific backgrounds to the study of European integration and trans-national identity formation, viewed as contested and contingent historical processes. We will examine the visions that informed the institutional work of Europe’s “founding fathers,” but we will also focus on the often-contentious debates which, almost from the beginning, surrounded the practices and meanings of political and economic governance, citizenship, and cultural identity. Thus, we will set Brexit and the rise of populism in their historical contexts. 

Topics will include not only a historical overview of the institutional innovations that have led from post-WWII reconstruction to the adoption of a single currency (the Euro) in 2002 and the current financial crisis, but also a discussion of how Europeans have encouraged and resisted integrative processes at the levels of technological change, popular culture, and social movements.

Political Science Research Design,"This course provides an introduction for undergraduate students to the methods that political scientists (and other social scientists) use to generate and answer questions about the world around us. The goals of this course are to:

   provide you with the tools to evaluate critically social science research, and 
   improve your ability to pose and answer research questions of your own.

 
In order to conduct political science research, you need to know how to: 

  formulate a research question, 
  develop hypotheses, 
   design a research plan appropriate to test those hypotheses,    collect data, and 
  analyze that data. 

In order to evaluate social science research, you need to be able to identify and constructively critique all of these stages in someone else’s research.
 
This class is designed to help you begin to make a transition from being solely a consumer of knowledge to being a producer of knowledge.  Along the way, I hope you will become a more thoughtful, critical, skeptical, and appreciative consumer of all types of information you receive in the world around you — whether from scholarly articles, news sources, or in the course of casual conversation. You will better be able to identify problems in the research of others — and also develop a greater understanding of just how hard it is to develop good research. The analytical skills you develop in this class should help you assess the quality of information that you encounter regardless of where you go after graduation — to graduate school, law school, government, or the business world. It is all required for all students intending to enter the Political Science Honors concentration: by the end of the academic term, you will have produced a research proposal that, with the guidance of your advisor, may form the basis of a proposal for your Honors thesis.Intended Audience:This class is for students who are Sophomores or Juniors with a 3.0 GPA or higher; Declared Political Science major.","Burns,Nancy E",POLSCI,381,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, SS",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

"Sports, Politics, and Society","Few things have characterized mass culture in the 20th century more consistently and thoroughly than sports. Particularly in their team variety, there is not one industrial country in the world that does not possess at least one major team sport which has attained hegemonic dimensions in that country’s culture in the course of the previous century. There can simply be no doubt that team sports as a form of mass culture have been among the most essential ingredients of public life in the 20th century. If anything, their cultural importance has increased in the beginning years of the 21st. Indeed, all indications are that this importance will grow in years to come. Why has this been the case? And how did this happen? Moreover, why did the United States deviate from much of the rest of the industrial world not in terms of the presence of such sports, but in their number and kind? Briefly put, why are baseball, football, and basketball (as well as ice hockey to a certain extent) the hegemonic team sports that defined American mass culture throughout the 20th century whereas no other industrial country has more than two such hegemonic team sports, most often indeed only one — soccer? Why has this sports map remained so stable throughout a highly volatile and ever-changing century? Will this stability persist into the new millennium or will new forces challenge these hegemonic sports and contest them in their respective cultural space? Will the United States become a major soccer power and will Americans be glued to events in this sport as they have been in those of baseball, football, basketball, and hockey for many decades? And, conversely, will soccer-obsessed Europeans come to love basketball and other American sports as much as they have loved soccer? Lastly, will China incorporate both sports cultures and excel at one or the other — or even both — eventually surpassing its American and European teachers? And what about the massive proliferation of video-based and Internet-driven sports phenomena that are scrambling all of the aforementioned phenomena?","Markovits,Andrei S",POLSCI,386,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, SS",,One introductory course in sociology or political science.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Contemporary Political Science,"This course is about the design and functioning of international cooperation through contemporary international organizations. Under what conditions would nation-states collaborate to solve common problems, when everything about their environment encourages them not to do so? By its very nature, the “chessboard” of international relations leaves little room for cooperative endeavors between nation-states, who are naturally predisposed, for their survival, to be inimical, suspicious, and short-sighted in their behavior toward one another. This is because they interact and strategize in an environment in which there is no formal authority (anarchy) and the only international law that exists is dependent on the voluntary agreement by sovereigns to abide by it when it is in their interest to do so. How do international organizations nonetheless sometimes come to be?

Race and the Shaping of American Politics,"From the war on drugs and mass incarceration to fatal police shootings; from slavery and Jim Crow to the “underclass” as myth and symbol; from the dispossession of Native lands and bans on Asian immigration to the racial politics of Mexican immigration and the “illegal alien”; from the New Deal to the rise of the modern Republican Party and the use of race, welfare, immigration and taxes as mechanisms of political realignment. This course examines how race has surged powerfully through American politics, shaping the unfolding of politics and party contests over time. We will examine race as an evolving ideology and system of power, “decoding” the ways in which race infuses the politics of labor, drugs, housing, welfare, immigration, crime, and policing. Readings are drawn from multiple disciplines (political science, history, sociology, and law) and address theories of inequality, the construction of American citizenship, and American political development.","Brandwein,Pamela",POLSCI,427,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,Senior standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Democratization in Sub-Saharan Africa After the End of the Cold War,"In the years immediately following the fall of the Berlin Wall, democratization spread to sub-Saharan Africa. The number of countries there that held multi-party elections rose from 9 to more than 30 and today, nearly all countries in sub-Saharan Africa now hold elections. This course investigates sub-Saharan Africa’s shift towards democracy, the subsequent authoritarian back-sliding of many countries, and the impact of electoral competition on different aspects of political life.


The first part of the course examines Africa’s political regimes in the Cold War period: how did leaders stay in power in the absence of elections? The middle part follows the political openings that took place in the early 1990s, showing how they reflected international trends towards democratization as well patterns specific to the sub-continent. The third part of the course looks at selected topics affected by electoral competition, including economic growth, clientelism, public goods provision, decentralization and electoral violence.","Hassan,Mai",POLSCI,455,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Advanced Topics in Contemporary Political Science,"This course will look at contemporary German politics through the prism of history. It will explore the main political, social, cultural, and economic features and issues of the Federal Republic of Germany in a European context. By analyzing previous political regimes that governed Germany just in the 20th century — absolute monarchy, unstable liberal democracy, totalitarian fascism, stable liberal democracy, bureaucratic communism — the course will shed light on the vicissitudes of the ""German Question"" and its importance for European politics as a whole. We will look at Germany’s domestic developments and also its relations with other countries, most notably those in Europe, east and west, the United States and the Soviet Union (Russia). In terms of the country’s domestic scene, we will focus on the main actors and purveyors of political life — the political parties and their world. We will look at these parties' history, structures, colors, ideologies, personalities, policies, slogans, leaders and prospects. We will anchor each of these parties in their proper historical context. We will also study societal developments in Germany that have happened outside the parties. In particular, we will look at social movements and interest groups that have played a major role in the transformation of German public life over the past 60 some years. Lastly, we will feature Germany’s contemporary political life in the context of the European Union, arguably among the greatest and most exciting state-building processes of our time.","Markovits,Andrei S",POLSCI,489,"Fall 2021, ",Section 012, - German Politics in Europe Since 1945,3,ULWR,,Seniors only.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Advanced Topics in Contemporary Political Science,"This seminar is designed to introduce students to the study of political violence in Africa. The course specifically examines domestic or intra-state manifestations of violence through a variety of theoretical and empirical approaches. Over the course of the semester, we will see that violence is not something endemic to the continent; instead, we will investigate violence as the outcome of political and economic conditions and processes. To do so, we will consider specific events in African countries while also using social science concepts and methods to examine and explain broad patterns across the continent. In conducting this exploration, we will primarily rely on and build upon the work of political scientists, but will also draw on the contributions of journalists, anthropologists, psychologists, economists, and historians.","Davis, Justine Maisha",POLSCI,489,"Fall 2021, ",Section 013, - Political Violence in Africa,3,,,Seniors only.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Advanced Topics in Contemporary Political Science,"In 1994, observers proclaimed the end of apartheid in South Africa a ""miracle"" and applauded the creation of a vibrant, inclusive democracy in that country.  Nearly quarter of a century later, vast economic inequalities remain, unemployment has worsened, and urban voters are beginning to abandon the ruling African National Congress.  Is democracy in danger in South Africa?  Why have economic disparities persisted? How are South African citizens navigating political and economic hardships and expressing their discontent?   This course explores the legacy of apartheid and the resulting spatial compartmentalization of housing, neighborhoods, schools, clincis, and social life in South Africa.  It will investigate the institutionalization of racist and segregationist legislation under apartheid, as well as the protests and resistance that followed from such acts.  We will examine the legacies left by legislation such as the Group Areas Act that defined living space according to the colour of one's skin or the Bantu Education Act, which created separate educational experiences for whites and blacks.  The course will cover successive democratic elections since 1994 and discuss the contemporary challenges posed by the lack of jobs, housing, and other goods; the ANC as a dominant party; persistent educational inequities; and the strains of urbanization and immigration. Finally, we will also examine the expression of hope and resistance in popular culture, from radio programs and blogs to student demonstrations.  Where appropriate, we will draw on theoretical and empirical research in comparative politics to situate the South African experience in relation to other countries that have had a history of segregation and/or have undergone transitions to democracy.","Pitcher, Anne  ",POLSCI,489,"Fall 2021, ",Section 014," - Culture, Class and Conflict in Southern Africa",3,ULWR,,Seniors only.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Advanced Topics in Contemporary Political Science,"This seminar provides advanced undergraduates an inter-related treatment of economic development, international trade and finance, and the domestic institutional underpinnings of growth and stability. The focus is comparative, historical, and analytical. We examine traditional themes and foundational questions in political and economic development and then pose questions specific to the contemporary period of globalization. Why are some societies able to escape vicious cycles of poverty and make the critical transition to sustained growth and economic well-being? Why are others not able to do so? Why do some parts of the globe (such as portions of Latin and Central America, Eastern Europe, and Sub- Saharan Africa) seem to miss the promise and fruit of an increasingly globalized world while other regions (notably East Asia and the BRICS group of nations) respond to expanding trading and financial liberalization with dynamism and profit? Throughout, a running comparison with the earlier experiences of Western nations is used as an analytical and historical benchmark to assess the more recent experiences of developing nations. Finally, in the current age of pandemics, we relate these enduring themes to the difficult period that globalization is undergoing, and what this means for different parts of the world.","Joshi,Ishan",POLSCI,489,"Fall 2021, ",Section 015, - International Development,3,,,Seniors only.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Undergraduate Seminar in Political Theory,"Can we imagine the United States without the work ethic? What did the
U.S. founders think about work? How does the work ethic shape the practice of good
citizenship in a liberal democratic republic? Does diligent work make you a model American
citizen?  Does work enhance virtue? Are there more and less virtuous ways for the state to
organize and regulate work, for employers to manage workers, and for consumers to spend in
the marketplace? Until the mid-twentieth century, a shorter workweek was a central goal of
the labor movement; should this goal be revived? What is the appeal of more leisure time? Or,
would more leisure time be risky, leading to corrosive, stagnant idleness? Is there a universal
or “best” way to theorize the experience of work (something you will be doing for many years)?
How will robots and automation shape the nature of work in the future?
This class will look at traditional ways of thinking about work, virtue, and citizenship AND will
explore your normative thinking about how these issues are best understood as we move
towards the future.  We will look at political theory texts, as well as a range of other kinds of

Advanced Portuguese Conversation and Composition,"The main objective of this course is to help students develop three primary language skills: comprehension, speaking, and writing at an advanced level. In order to reach this goal we will engage in various communicative activities based on cultural topics and everyday situations throughout the Portuguese-speaking world.

Specific Objectives

To improve the grammatical level of spoken and written Portuguese
To develop the ability to read literary and non-literary texts as well as to understand film in Portuguese
To develop skills related to communicating complex ideas in oral and written forms



This course counts toward the Portuguese minor requirements.


This course counts toward the Spanish major as a cognate course (300-level).Class Format:We will read online version of influential newspapers and magazines that focus on current affairs; watch documentaries and films; listen to music; and read literary texts and crônicas, exposing students to a variety of voices and images of the Lusophone world. By the end of the semester, students will have developed a general cultural literacy of the Portuguese-speaking world and we hope that an appreciation of the cultural diversity of each country.","Segarra Costaguta Mattos,Maria Teresa",PORTUG,287,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Literature in the Portuguese-Speaking World,"This course is an advanced introduction to the study of literature written in Portuguese from Brazil, Portugal, Angola, and Mozambique. We will study a select group of authors and texts that are representative of the modern and contemporary literatures of these Lusophone countries. The course objectives are: 

 the dissemination of knowledge based on canonical and non-canonical literary works from the Portuguese-speaking world; 
 the acquisition of analytical tools for textual interpretation of novels, short stories, and poetry; 
 the expansion and improvement of Portuguese linguistic proficiency, both oral and written; 
 the use the literary text as a tool to better understand the cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world, particularly, social, cultural, and political questions that are germane to these countries, but that may also address universal humanistic concerns.

Advanced Topics in Afro-Luso-Brazilian Cultures,"Across Latin America in the last decades, there has been a surge of works of historical fiction — primarily novels, but also plays films, and telenovelas — that take slavery, racial discrimination, and violence, wars of conquest against indigenous peoples, or inter-racial romances as their subject.  Though fictional, these works explicitly engage with contemporary historical debates, often seeking to center marginal historical characters and viewpoints in order to create alternative national histories that promote greater racial inclusion, awareness, or equality.  We will focus on two case studies: Argentina and Brazil. 
 While in Argentina (long regarded as a mainly white and culturally European country), several historians and novelists have sought to rewrite national history to reflect processes of racial mixture and the presence of non-white people, in Brazil, historians and novelists have worked to debunk longstanding visions of society as racially mixed and harmonious, focusing on topics like racism, slavery, activism, and memory.  We will examine fictional works alongside historical documents and the writings of historians themselves to try to understand how history and fiction reflect and shape ideas about race in each country, and how these cases compare or differ from one another.
This course counts toward the literature requirement for the Spanish minor.Class Format:The course will be taught in English, with readings in English as well as in Spanish and Portuguese (students must be able to read and speak at course level for at least one of these Romance languages; reading knowledge of the other is encouraged, but not required).","Alberto,Paulina Laura",PORTUG,474,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Comparative Topics in Spanish and Portuguese: Stories and Histories of Race in Brazil and Argentina,3,,,PORTUG 287 or its equivalent to prove advanced proficiency in Portuguese.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Introduction to Political Economy,"This course will introduce students to the political economy through a study of markets. Markets shape our lives in profound ways, yet understanding how they function (or fail to function) requires sophisticated knowledge of philosophy, politics, and economics. In this course we will aim to avoid a simplistic understanding of markets as wholly good or bad; instead, we will ask under what conditions markets work well, and whether there are things that even well-functioning markets cannot or should not do.


We will consider a number of advantages of markets, from improving human life to coordinating action, as well as disadvantages of markets, including externalities and the public goods problem. We will also ask what the boundaries of the market should be: Should there be a market for drugs, reproductive labor, and human kidneys? Toward the end of the course, we will apply our knowledge of markets to a controversial area of public policy: healthcare.

By the end of the course, students will be familiar with concepts like a market failure, the prisoner’s dilemma, the tragedy of the commons, and the free-rider problem. Along the way, we will read a number of historically important philosophers and political economists, including Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Hayek, as well as contemporary scholars like Debra Satz and Elizabeth Anderson.Course Requirements:Two papers and two exams.Intended Audience:All students interested in exploring the political economy are welcome.

First-Year Seminar in Psychology as a Social Science,"People are concerned about the state of our natural environment, with increasing interest in climate change, pollution, sustainable food production, and conservation. Despite this growing concern—and efforts by public and private interests to increase sustainability—we often fail to change behavior. Psychological research is needed to help us translate knowledge about sustainability into real behavior change. Existing approaches have tried to reach people through fear, social norms, personal values, and the desire to belong or to surpass others. In addition, “nudge” techniques try to passively change behavior. We need to evaluate these approaches and suggest new ones. Students will learn about some of our most pressing environmental issues and the psychological research that addresses them.","Preston,Stephanie D",PSYCH,120,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Sustainability: Can Psychology Save the Planet?,3,SS,FYSem,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.","Does not count toward the requirements for the Psychology major nor the major in Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neuroscience.",May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Second, the class will help students critically evaluate and analyze children’s books with regard to the underlying messages they provide.  


We will look at the evolution of children’s books over the last several decades and the ways in which they correspond to our understanding of psychological theory and the developmental challenges faced by children. Students will discuss the ways in which books encourage children’s ability to categorize, build concepts, enhance language skills and come to understand themselves and the broader social world.    Book selections focus on thematic and topical issues  
ranging from divorce, war, sibling relationships, traumatic life events, gender roles, peer relationships and bullying, chronic and terminal illness, race and culture.   Students will be exposed to a  variety of children’s picture and chapter books, from the classics to  more contemporary selections.Course Requirements:Students will be expected to keep a journal of the weekly readings for the  course as well as complete several short response papers.

Introduction to Behavioral Neuroscience,"This course surveys the field of Biopsychology. It introduces the kinds of questions traditionally addressed in behavioral neuroscience. The major focus is on how psychological processes relate to the brain.  This includes how brain processes cause psychological events and behavior, and how psychological events are encoded in the brain. Another focus is on how brain systems and psychological processes (e.g., perception, cognition) differ across different species, and on how these systems and processes have been shaped by evolutionary pressures (comparative or evolutionary psychology).

 Topics will include: principles of behavioral evolution; neuronal mechanisms and brain anatomy; neurochemical signals and their relation to psychoactive drugs; and the brain systems that mediate action, perception, motivation, learning, and cognition in humans and other species.Course Requirements:No data submittedIntended Audience: NOTE: This course is intended primarily for sophomores and second-term first-year students who have ALREADY taken a course in introductory psychology.

Language and Human Mind,"This course introduces students to the “cognitive revolution” and its impact on the contemporary study of language. We review the shift away from seeing speech behavior or “languages” as the object of inquiry to the experimental and theoretical study of the cognitive mechanisms underlying our unique human capacity for language, the exercise of which permeates virtually every aspect of human life, including what you are now doing! In every household, all of the children, barring pathology - but none of the dogs, cats or other organisms (nor the inanimate objects!) - acquire the language spoken (or signed) by the adults. There is some biological property of humans that makes this feat possible. What do we know when we know a language, and what does it mean to say that humans have an innate capacity for language?","Brennan,Jonathan R",PSYCH,242,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,Does not count toward the requirements for the Psychology major.,May not be repeated for credit.,

Introduction to Abnormal Psychology,"Abnormal psychology entails the scientific study of aberrant behaviors, broadly defined. However, there is no universal consensus on the definition, classification, and treatment of psychological disorders. As we shall quickly see, what is deemed abnormal and how it develops or is treated will partly depend on the particular perspective taken. Hence, a key goal of this course is to guide students toward a broad and critical understanding of 'abnormal behavior' from a number of different perspectives.

Practicum in Teaching and Leading Groups,"This section is for students returning to the Michigan Mentorship Program.  This experiential learning course is designed to provide mentoring experiences for students in the Ann Arbor Public Schools who are regarded at risk for low achievement. We will pair college students with elementary and high school students in order to help students with homework, to encourage effective learning strategies, to set goals, and to help them develop appropriate coping strategies. College students who can relate to younger students' concerns are a tremendous resource for their learning and motivation. Conversely, college students can learn a great deal from children and adolescents as they work through issues.
The course will provide a personal relationship and useful academic information in order to help grade school students become more successful and more motivated in school.

American Addictions,"

Addiction is national news. From the opioid epidemic to overusing smartphones, addiction is at the center of both public and private life today. Each of us has been touched by it—personally, among family and friends, or as part of a wide-ranging conversation made up of scientific studies, intimate confessions, policy debates, and popular media. This course explores these dimensions of addiction in both the past and the present, using history to illuminate current research and the current crisis. Each week, we explore a different substance or behavior from historical and present perspectives, working our way from early anxieties about alcohol abuse or problematic gambling in the nineteenth century to the latest research by social psychologists, neuroscientists, and public health experts. Part of the class is collaborative (students work in teams to write op-eds about crucial issues), while part of it focuses on individual research papers that will address an addiction of the student’s choosing.","Cowles,Henry",PSYCH,321,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Behavior and Environment,"This course deals with two central themes: 


  First, environmental problems are people's problems.  To promote environmental stewardship we must understand how we think, what we care about, what motivates us, and the conditions under which we behave more reasonably. 

Second, our behavior closely interacts with the environments we find ourselves in.   To understand why we act as we do, it is useful to understand the demands environments place upon, and the opportunities they afford human cognition.  


The course explores a model of human nature which includes:



      How people come to know and understand environments
	Which types of environments humans prefer
	How humans cope with non-preferred environments
	The role that mental fatigue and restoration have in everyday functioning


The course:


	Presents evidence of the strong connection between human health/well-being and the environment
	Discusses what human information processing has to say about:
  Design (e.g., architecture, landscapes, planning, urban 
             settings,institutions)
  Effective communication (e.g., teaching in general, communicating 
             about the environment)
  Program implementation (e.g., behavior change in general, 
             promoting environmentally sustainable lifestyles)
	Explores strategies for better managing our time and choosing settings 
        in which we function more effectively


Students taking the course often have no previous experience in the psychology of human-environment interaction.  The course is useful to any field of study dealing with human behavior (e.g., environmental studies; education and communication; health education and behavior; conservation psychology; resource policy, planning, and management; organizational and institutional studies;  landscape architecture and urban planning; green and sustainable business)

Testosterone (and similar steroid hormones) is also known to affect sports performance and respond to the outcome of competition (e.g., winning leads to temporary increases in testosterone). Likewise, stress hormones can both respond to competition and influence performance across domains.","Bergman,Thore Jon",PSYCH,430,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - The Biopsychology of Sports,3,BS,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

At its core, this course examines what increases the risk that children will develop behavior problems and go onto to more chronic and extreme forms of violence and psychopathic personality that results in harm to others. 

We will examine psychiatric diagnoses associated with these antisocial behaviors in both childhood and adulthood and how they link to other relevant behaviors (e.g., substance use, ADHD).  We will explore research elucidating the neural correlates of these behaviors, potential genetic mechanisms underlying these behaviors, and the environments that increase risk for these behaviors. Thus, there will be a focus on neurobiology and genetics approaches to psychiatric outcomes, as well as a social science approach to understanding these harmful behaviors, all while considering development across time. We will also consider ethical and moral implications of this research.","Hyde, Luke Williamson",PSYCH,477,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Inside the Criminal Mind: Neural, Genetic, and Environmental Contributions to Psychopathy, Violence and Aggression Across the Lifespan",3,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.

Why do some people cope effectively with and positively adapt/adjust to major life stress and adversity while others struggle? Resilience is not something we’re born with—it’s built over time as the experiences we have interact with our unique, individual genetic makeup. That’s why we all respond to life stressors differently, as we have seen in the COVID-19 pandemic, and resilience has never been more important in our age of uncertainty. So, how can YOU learn how to be more resilient so that you can be more successful in life and weather its inevitable storms?

Computational Social Sciences,"Due to the growth in electronic sources such as cell phones, Facebook, Twitter, and other online platforms, researchers now have enormous amounts of data about every aspect of our lives – from what we buy, to where we go, to who we know, to what we believe. This has led to a revolution in social science, as we are able to measure human behavior with precision largely thought impossible just a decade ago. Computational Social Science is an exciting and emerging field that sits at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and social science. This course provides a hands-on, non-technical introduction to the methods and ideas of Computational Social Science. We will discuss how new online data sources and the methods that are being used to analyze them can shed new light on old social science questions, and also ask brand new questions. We will also explore some of the ethical and privacy challenges of living in a world where big data and algorithmic decision-making have become more commonplace. Each week, students will have the opportunity to try their hand at analyzing big data from sources ranging from online dating profiles to New York City taxicabs to #metoo Tweets and other sources.

Introduction to Deaf Culture,"This course introduces students to Deaf culture within the United States and focuses on the link between culture and language (in this case, American Sign Language). An analysis of medical and cultural models of perceiving deafness is investigated to familiarize students with the range of perceptions held by members of the cultural majority and the effect it has on the Deaf community. The influencing factors of educational systems on deaf children are reviewed to understand the link between language systems used in the classroom and the development of Deaf identity.  The historical roots of American Sign Language and the value of language preservation provide for an additional overview of attitudes in American society.  Social adaptations to deafness and individual factors of communicative and linguistic development are analyzed for understanding the implications of family and social systems on deaf children and adults.","Berwanger,Paula D",RCASL,100,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

First Year Seminar,"Representations of Muslims that dominate in the West typically present two monolithic images—that of the terrorist and that of the victim (of either Islamist fundamentalism or Western warfare). It is rare that representations of Muslims by Muslims rise to prominence within the West that are not either framed as a “humanizing project” aimed at making Muslims more sympathetic or derided for reaffirming Islamophobic stereotypes in order to appeal to a Western audience. These flawed or incomplete representations can have real-life societal and political consequences—from interpersonal misunderstandings to impacting the formation of legislation and international policy. In this first-year seminar, which satisfies the First-Year Writing Requirement, we will complicate and critique these depictions of Islam and Muslims by examining representations of Islam by Muslims and individuals from the Islamic world across diverse forms of contemporary cultural expression and consider the impact that more diverse representation can have on a local and global scale. 
Readings will include scholarly discussions of representations of Muslims in cultural production and address questions including: How has 9/11 and the rise of the global “war on terror” altered these representations? What is the effect of the conflation of Muslims and individuals from the so-called Islamic World (aka Middle East/Near East/West Asia)? How are cultural producers challenging assumptions about hijabi (veiled) women? How have representations of Islam translated to real-world impacts on a social and political scale? We’ll examine works across media including the visual arts, film, literature, graphic novels, and even video games. Examples of what we’ll be looking at include Shirin Neshat’s Women of Allah series, Ayad Akhtar’s play Disgraced, and Marjane Satrapi’s graphic novel Persepolis to name a few. Writing assignments will include critical analysis of a work, an exhibition review, and a final argumentative research paper about an artist or work and its place in scholarly conversations about representations of Islam. These essays will examine the potential and/or observed impacts of these depictions on our contemporary lives. Students will revise drafts of these essays using instructor feedback as well as engaging in peer review. No prior knowledge of Islam or the Islamic World required.","Crasnow,Sascha M",RCCORE,100,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Representing Islam,4,FYWR,,"SWC Writing Assessment.

First Year Seminar,"“So far as I am concerned, poetry and every other art was and is and forever will be strictly and distinctly a question of individuality.” - e e cummings, 1953

Creativity and the aesthetic response are among the most complex, pleasurable, and sometimes frustrating of human experiences. In this course, we will explore the psychological and neuropsychological science behind artistic creativity and appreciation in the arts. We will ask: What is creativity? What is the creative process? Is there more than one? Does creativity differ across various fields and various media? What do creative individuals actually do in the process of creating? Is appreciating a work of art also a creative experience? Is there a science of individuality? What is the role of collaboration?
As a class we will focus primarily on the visual arts, verbal arts, and music; however, in your final written project, you will be free to consider the creative process and aesthetic experience in any medium you choose. In addition to course content on psychology and neuropsychology in the arts, you will write several essays to satisfy the University’s First-Year Writing Requirement. You will write and re-write, listen and discuss, and learn to give and receive constructive comments on your writing. Most writing in this course involves the use of evidence in support of an argument or point of view; evidence can include your own experience, that of others, and of published writing and other media, all properly cited and credited. In addition to time in class, we may attend a University Musical Society event outside of class, either in-person or virtually, on an evening or weekend.

First Year Seminar,"In this writing course, we will listen to, cultivate, analyze and play with conversation as it manifests in a variety of forms—podcasts, novels, essays, diptychs, oral histories, and documentaries. In examining particularly artful exchanges, we will ask: What is the goal of a good conversation? How does silence play a role? What tips can we glean by comparing the interviewing style of public radio icons? How do race, gender, and ability play a role in what is spoken, said, or heard? How have we been impacted by the aesthetic conventions of social media and reality tv? How would our lives change if our approach to conversation shifted? Possible texts include Miranda July’s New York Times interview with Rihanna, Thich Nhat Hanh’s discourse on deep listening, Rebecca Solnit’s “Men Explain Things to Me,” and Claudia Rankine’s Just Us: An American Conversation. Throughout the course, we will write analytically about conversations of all kinds. We will keep a conversation journal.

What role do cities play in American culture and politics? This first year seminar will explore these questions and issues of power, privilege, race, and social justice through a historical study of twentieth-century urban America. We’ll focus on the people who make up American metropolises; the public policies that have shaped American cities; and the role of place in making and encountering urban history. We will take advantage of the many ways to understand the history of American cities, through scholarly texts and first-hand accounts, maps and spatial data, popular culture, photographs, and a field trip beyond the classroom. Students will practice writing in a variety of genres, including historical source analyses, evidence-based argument-driven essays, personal reflections, creative historical fiction, and editorials.

I believe everything good has a shape. Shapes are the way in which we know who we are and where we are in our universe. Show me the shapes and forms a man gives to his life, and I will tell you whether he is a master or victim of that life. –Gail Godwin
 
Many people have heard the expression: “You are where you live.” Or, “the importance of Eating Local.” But how much of who we are is tied up in where we are from or where we live now? In this course, we will be exploring non-linear examples of writing about place. We’ll be reading poetry and creative nonfiction that will include examples from the highly personal narrative of memoir, to new journalism, to researched and historically-based pieces, to the “lyric essay,” which borrows elements of poetry. We will explore how image systems, form/shape, and repetition can act as a kind of structuring that more accurately (in some cases) and creatively recreates the truth of a shared experience. We’ll examine, as the former president and farmer John Adams asserted --the good, the beautiful, and the true-- what it means to be a citizen of planet earth. How can your writing, while telling a story of true experience, also be about history, beauty or something larger? In this course we will be reading excerpts from the Eco-poetry anthology, Black Nature, books on how our founding fathers were all farmers, Claudia Rankine’s Citizen, a meditation on race and identity, City: An Essay, by Brian Lennon, The Botany of Desire by Michael Pollan, and work by Nick Flynn, Annie Dillard, Wendell Berry, and Sherman Alexi. We’ll write and revise four essays, have guest writers and farmers, and then complete a creative final project, no holds barred.

First Year Seminar,"What happens when ideas hold the possibility of revolution? Can thoughts be so powerful that they allow us to see what had previously been invisible to us? Can they shake our presumed footing to the core? This course will take up some of the most thought-provoking ideas in modern history, asking us to question, throughout the process, everything we thought we knew. We will read work from groundbreaking thinkers like Louis Althusser, Angela Davis, Jack Halberstam, and Audre Lorde, as we seek to understand not only why their ideas may be considered revolutionary but also how they impact our current world. Along the way, we will use a range of writing techniques to help us think more deeply about these ideas, from informal journaling to peer review, revision, research, and comparative and textual analysis. This is a writing-intensive course, and, as such, we will use writing to sharpen our thinking as well as developing, deepening, and honing our writing skills as we go.
This course explores a wide range of political, social, and cultural beliefs. No one thinker, value system, or political party is presumed; instead, we will practice deep listening and open-minded contemplation as we consider how these radical ideas create productive dialogue and tension. Further, we must all (instructor included!) be prepared to embrace uncertainty: What happens when we come up against the limits of what is currently knowable to us? How might we welcome the often difficult process of critical thinking? And how might simply being present with these certain difficulties sow the seeds of compassionate change?Intended Audience:As a DC (Distance due to COVID) course, all aspects of this course will be fully compatible with remote online learning.Class Format:Instruction mode: As a DC (Distance due to COVID) course, all aspects of this course will be fully compatible with remote online learning.

First Year Seminar,"When Malcolm X was incarcerated in 1946 at age 20, he was functionally illiterate. By painstakingly copying page after page of the dictionary, however, he taught himself to read, ultimately proclaiming, “Months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up to then, I never had been so truly free in my life.” In this first-year writing seminar, we will explore how writers discuss and help us to understand various experiences of confinement and liberation/freedom. Together we will ask: What are ways that people experience physical, emotional, linguistic, and/or social confinement? How is confinement imposed and by whom? What does resistance look like, and what do confinement and resistance have to tell us about liberation and freedom? We will engage with diverse authors, texts, and genres, and students will develop and hone their writing skills through varied short writing assignments; 3-4 major essays; and regular peer reviews and essay revisions.","Pickus, Becca  ",RCCORE,100,"Fall 2021, ",Section 008," - Narratives of Confinement, Narratives of Liberation",4,FYWR,,"SWC Writing Assessment.

First Year Seminar,"Popular music is the soundtrack of our adolescence and young adulthood. It contextualizes our loves, our friendships, and our break ups, it animates our choices, and it helps us discover who we are. This vast collection of subgenres spans at least seventy years, thousands of artists, and countless perspectives on love, power, and the politics of gender, race, and class. And any given song can feel as personal to us as our own skin. 
This writing seminar dives into American popular music, going far beyond the lyrics. Participants build skills in “by ear” musical analysis of melody and harmony—no note-reading required!—in order to better perceive and explore the ways the music itself constructs and communicates meaning. This loosely chronological study incorporates participants’ interests and draws on media such as documentary films, podcasts, and a variety of styles of writing. Students expand their capacity to listen deeply and, using a growing lexicon of technically precise language, discuss the music’s crucial contributions to a song’s meaning in a respectful, supportive seminar. Over the semester students write about music at several different registers, including succinct journalistic album reviews, creative personal essays (a la Nick Hornby) that sidle up to narrative while getting into how music accomplishes such subtle—or enormous—emotional feats, and analytical essays (such as those by Lori Burns, Nadine Hubbs, and others) requiring the elegant presentation of carefully collected and interpreted evidence to make an argument. Students hone their writing skills with revisions based on detailed feedback from the professor and rigorous peer review.
Topics in popular music are sometimes sexual—they don’t call it “sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll” for nothing—and discussions will invariably address this and other sensitive issues. If you anticipate this causing you discomfort, the course may not be right for you.","Goltz-Taylor,Jennifer E",RCCORE,100,"Fall 2021, ",Section 009," - Revealing Meaning in the Music of Rock, Pop, and Hip-Hop",4,FYWR,,"SWC Writing Assessment.

First Year Seminar,"It’s been called gonzo journalism, new journalism, literary nonfiction, and feature-writing. Its practitioners have hung out with motorcycle gangs, jumped on empty freight cars, worked as kitchen slaves, and trekked through Florida swamps with an accused orchid thief—all in the interest of writing a telling story. Narrative journalism encompasses a range of styles and has gone by a number of names. But fundamentally it is a rigorous interview- and observation-based journalism that goes beyond the facts and employs all five senses to consciously—and artfully—tell a story. According to Mitchell Zukoff, a former reporter for The Boston Globe, the elements of narrative journalism “aren't much different than what works in any good story: a plot with inherent tension, well-developed characters, [and] a theme that transcends the immediate story to capture something universal.”","Rosegrant,Susan Ruth",RCCORE,100,"Fall 2021, ",Section 010, - Truth Through Story: the Art and Craft of Narrative Journalism,4,FYWR,,"SWC Writing Assessment.

First Year Seminar,"“How brightly the clear moonlight speaks to me,
Gives me courage for the journey:
‘Follow true the ancient pathway,
Choose no homeland for yourself!’”
--Friedrich von Schlegel, set to music by Franz Schubert

Human beings have always been nomadic. In a country like the United States, most of us have only been here for a few generations. Even much older countries have been changed beyond recognition, again and again, by massive migrations over hundreds and thousands of years. Poetry is an expression of the instinct to wander - from the leisurely travels of the fortunate to the plight of immigrants and refugees, to perpetual wandering as a conscious choice. In this writing course we will look at how, through the medium of translation, poetry moves in a landscape beyond national and cultural boundaries, and lives both at the core and outer edges of language.

We will read poems from different historical periods, from medieval China to nineteenth-century Europe to our own globalized times, tracing how dreams and visions and even the languor of a long-gone afternoon echo across vast stretches of time. We will also explore music and visual art inspired by poetry, moving toward a notion of “poetics” that embraces all of life. Students are encouraged to draw connections of sense and sensibility between texts from disparate sources. This will happen through in-class discussion, written responses both analytic and creative, and three essays that will be written and revised through the course of the semester.

First Year Seminar,"When speakers of British English say “pissed"", they mean “drunk”; when speakers of American English say “pissed,” they mean “angry.” This difference in meaning has likely led to some (amusing?) cross-cultural misunderstandings!  But language differences can also have more significant consequences. In 1979, the author James Baldwin wrote that language is a political instrument which “reveals the private identity, and connects one with, or divorces one from, the larger, public, or communal identity.”  We will examine Baldwin’s assertion and ask: How are perceptions of individual and group identities tied to language? How much does language reveal about us—about our age, race, ethnicity, politics, and worldviews? Our study of language will cover a range of topics including accents, linguistic profiling, gender-neutral pronouns, code-switching, regional language variations (soda or pop?), language evolution and extinction, translation, sign language, slang, swearing, and invented languages. Course materials will include articles by linguists such as David Crystal and John McWhorter, as well as podcasts, documentaries, movie clips, Youtube selections, and sketch comedy (Key & Peele, etc.). 


This class fulfills LSA’s First-Year Writing Requirement (FYWR). Over the course of the semester, students will develop their attentiveness to language in their own writing. Assignments will provide the opportunity to write in a variety of modes including informal journal entries, reading responses, personal narratives, peer reviews, and two research-based analytical essays. Multiple revisions will be required for all formal writing assignments. In consultation with the instructor, students will generate their own topics for the final essay of the semester based upon individual interests.

First Year Seminar,"Even before Covid-19 changed our lives and put health at the forefront of everyone’s mind, we still heard about health all the time—flyers in the dorm or on the bus, ads on TV, magazine covers, bestselling books, YouTube channels: They all want us to follow their advice to be healthy. 

What is health, though?

Is it a possession? A state of being? A process? An appearance or look? 

Why does it seem wrong and bad to be unhealthy?

This class will use guided reading and intensive writing, revision, and peer review in order to explore those questions and introduce students to the interdisciplinary Health Humanities. This course will fulfill the First-Year Writing Requirement and challenge students to thoughtfully and critically write about health from a variety of perspectives and through a variety of genres. We will examine health as a state of being, a morality, and anesthetic. We will think critically about how ideas of health and disease: (1) change over time, (2) influence identity and society, and (3) have hidden politics. This means we will be dealing with sensitive political, philosophical, and ethical issues. In order to do this, we will engage with a broad array of sources from the 1880s to the present: from gothic short stories like “The Yellow Wall-Paper;” to feminist histories of medicine; to decolonial social criticism, such as “No Humans Involved: An Open Letter to my Colleagues;” all the way to contemporary pharmaceutical ads and horror movies.","Brady,Jennifer",RCCORE,100,"Fall 2021, ",Section 013,,4,FYWR,,"SWC Writing Assessment.

In this course, we will study the history of elections and campaigns from the nation’s founding to the 2020 race. This writing-intensive course fulfills the First-Year Writing Requirement.

First Year Seminar,"What is it that drives us to sports as fans and as athletes? What is it that makes us break our bodies and the bodies of others in the name of performed victories? What ethical, (bio)political, and sociological questions do athletics raise? How can contemporary literature—the things we read, the things we write—engage with sport? With a reading list that includes essays, poems, and fiction by Natalie Diaz, Ross Gay, Claudia Rankine, Rowan Ricardo Phillips, Amy Lam, and others, we will explore crucial intersections between categories that are often kept separate: body and mind, skill and will, craft and force. The questions we’ll approach through these texts and our own writing will challenge us all: questions of the body, of experience, of desire; community questions (the team, the league, the nation-state); and individual (ethical, personal) ones.
In this course, we will move through many modes of college-level writing, including writing essays that demonstrate close reading, textual analysis, and synthetic analysis, and creative writing, including a culminating personal essay or open-genre (fiction, poetry, nonfiction, hybrid) exploration of our course questions. We will read and respond carefully to each other’s work, growing as peer reviewers and as writers. Students can expect to leave this course with 25+ pages of revised, polished writing.
This course is open to athletes and non-athletes; creative writers, creative readers, and creative thinkers; anyone who is excited to encounter the complex and complicated experiences reflected by contemporary sports literature, and to deepen their engagement with athletics in both analytical and creative ways.

Special Topics,"College students today have grown up in a “gay-aware” if not “gay-friendly” world.  LGBT characters are everywhere on TV and in the movies. The debate over gay marriage fills the news with discussions of equal rights, states’ rights, and recently-lifted federal bans. In Michigan and other states, benefits for same-sex domestic partners are publicly championed by some cities and universities but regularly attacked in the legislatures.
How did LGBT people move from the mostly-anonymous fringe to front-and-center of today’s popular culture and political debates? This two-credit mini-course explores 20th century LGBT history in the United States through documentaries and archival research. We will be watching and discussing documentary films such as: 

Out of the Past (1998, 70 minutes) traces over 100 years of gay rights struggles, set against the backdrop of a 17-year-old student who forms a Gay Straight Alliance program at her high school.
Before Stonewall (1984, 87 minutes) traces the decades leading up to the Stonewall Riots of June 1969 through archival film clips and commentary by leading LGBT community members.
Stonewall Uprising (2011, 90 minutes) tells the story of the police-raid-turned-riot that sparked the start of the widespread, public gay right movement in the United States.
The Times of Harvey Milk (1984, 88 minutes) tells the story of San Francisco’s first openly-gay city supervisor who was assassinated in November 1978.
We Were Here (2011, 90 minutes) traces the arrival and initial impact of AIDS in San Francisco.
The Celluloid Closet (1995, 101 minutes), based on Vito Russo’s book of the same name, explores the portrayal of LGBT characters in Hollywood films from the silent era through the early 1990s.
After Stonewall (1999, 88 minutes), a sequel to the 1984 Before Stonewall film, traces the first 30 years after the Stonewall Riots.

In addition, students will have the opportunity to explore UM’s Bentley Historical Library’s large Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Collections. Students will keep a journal of personal responses to the films and write one term-paper (8-10 pages) based on their work at the Bentley Historical Library. There is no assigned reading for this course.

Special Topics,"This course looks at community-led movements, resistance, resilience, and liberation. This online course will focus on emerging community responses during the COVID-19 epidemic specifically as it relates to Detroit. Detroit is one of the nation's “hot spots” for the virus. What does this mean for a major city that was already battling the impacts of environmental injustice, poverty, racism, and a lack of healthcare access?  In this course, we will learn about how different community organizations are responding: some are shutting down operations while others are transforming their organizations completely to meet the needs of the community in innovative and creative ways.  Students will have opportunities to join efforts happening in Detroit now and remotely connect with organizations working to respond to community's ever-changing needs.  Projects range from helping the efforts to turn the water back on for the 10s of thousands of residents without water to orgs running town halls for mental health and grief and getting families and kids into remote sports activities to keep little league teams (and families) together.  Students in this course will have access to a number of online organizer tool kits and class conversations will also cover self-care for yourself as an organizer and providing care for others in the community.  Building on decades-long environmental justice organizing in the city of Detroit, everyone will come out of this class making a meaningful contribution to the current crisis in Detroit, build their own “organizers tool-kit” full of activities to take with them into any community organization scenario as well as a number of self-care sessions.

How to Think (Arts),"This class, a part of the Arts and Ideas curriculum at the Residential College, is a combination art studio and humanities class designed to address the question of how to think about art through immersion in a making process. Concentrating on a series of art processes this class explores and develops ideas in response to the physical manipulation of materials. Working from direct image-making techniques such as the cyanotype printing process the course will develop a vocabulary for making mixed-media images that incorporate digital negatives, printing, laser cutting, and painting. Students will ultimately combine these techniques to build imagery that establishes new and unexpected connections and perspectives. The manipulation and application of art processes and decision-making will be both challenged and confirmed by lectures, readings, and visits to available campus-wide media and art resources. Readings will include essays about art imagery and writings by and interviews with artists that bring us closer to understanding how individuals think about the visual art they create. The goal is to give us a better understanding of how to look art and ideas in the world we navigate and participate in. Creating community through discussion and the sharing of ideas and techniques are the hallmarks of this humanities art experience. This class requires no special equipment to create images and uses no-cost apps to refine and produce artwork for the class.

"The Art of Dance: An Introduction to American and European Dance History, Aesthetics, and Criticism","Did you know that Louis XIV was one of the greatest dancers of his time and that he used to dance to promote his political power? Did you know that George Balanchine’s ballet Agon was his way of championing civil rights in the year of Little Rock by creating one of his most powerful and intimate couple dances for a black man and a white woman? Did you know that Shakespeare and his company performed complex social dances to entertain their audiences at the finish of a play? Did you know that Michael Jackson did not invent the moonwalk?

The Experience of Arts and Ideas in the Nineteenth Century,"The nineteenth century was marked not only by revolutionary changes in society but also by artistic revolution. By the beginning of the twentieth century the conventions of style and subject matter of virtually every major art form – painting, music, dance, and literature – had been radically altered and the role of the artist in society had been radically redefined. This interdisciplinary course, open to all students, will examine some of these changes and the interaction of art and social change by offering an introduction to major movements in European art and cultural history of the nineteenth-century – Romanticism and Realism – by analyzing and comparing representative works of literature, painting, music, and dance. Among the works studied will be paintings by Delacroix, Courbet, Monet, Degas, and Van Gogh, the writings by E.T.A. Hoffman and Hans Christian Anderson, novels by Emily Brontë, Gustave Flaubert, the music of Beethoven, Berlioz and Debussy, and ballets of Perrot and Bournonville. We’ll be asking some of the following kinds of questions: What is the revolution of style and subject matter brought about by Romantic art? How does it reflect changes in the society that produced it? How do the fairytales of E. T. A. Hoffman, the ballet Giselle, and the Symphonie Fantastique of Berlioz reflect these changes and the new attitude of the artist towards himself and his art? Can we find similar aims in the realist novels of Flaubert and the realist painting of the Impressionists? How do they reflect the growing secularization of society brought about by scientific and political revolution?  Can we compare the revolution in the structure and subject matter of painting brought about by the Impressionist painters to the revolution in form brought to music by Debussy? What can we learn about the evolving view of women’s place in society by comparing the portrayal of women in paintings by Berthe Morisot and Edouard Manet and the portrayals of women the novels of Edith Wharton?

Central European Cinema,"

During four decades of Communist Party rule, the film industries of Central Europe were under state control. One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics. In certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in Central Europe were able to be more incisive, frank, and provocative than is often the case in profit-driven Hollywood film. Talented and committed filmmakers were able to take advantage of their regimes’ progressive official pronouncements with regard to ethnic and gender issues to craft powerful films which the regimes had no grounds to suppress. That legacy has carried on since the collapse of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, albeit uneasily, as new generations of filmmakers have delved into persistently troubling questions about the region’s past and present. In this course, we will examine the prewar roots of this tradition of critical filmmaking, its development through the Communist period, and how it has continued after the collapse of Communism. We will view and discuss fifteen films in chronological order (by production year) and consider their artistic structure—that is, how they go about transmitting their themes with power and emotion. We will use our developing sophistication in reading the films’ techniques to analyze what these films say about the intersecting themes of race, ethnicity, and gender during periods of social transition and crisis. There are no prerequisites. No knowledge of foreign languages is required. All readings and lectures will be conducted in English.","Paloff,Benjamin B",RCHUMS,312,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, HU, RE",,A knowledge of Russian is not required.,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.,

We will explore questions of why and how artistic activity can begin and/or support processes of reconciliation for people who have committed crimes and for crime victims.  Students in this class will facilitate weekly art workshops in adult prisons, juvenile detention centers, and community venues where former prisoners, crime victims, and the families of those groups can gather together.  Focusing on the themes of acknowledgment, apology, and atonement, the workshops will produce original performances, creative writing, and visual art presented at the end of the semester by both the student facilitators and the members of the workshop. Ultimately this course seeks to identify the best strategies for using the arts to address crime and those most affected by it.","Lucas,Ashley Elizabeth",RCHUMS,332,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

As boys and girls grow up distanced from farm and wildlife, how do other species animate what it means to be child and adult? This Upper-Level Writing Requirement course studies the aesthetic, generic, and rhetorical uses of animals in visual and verbal media.

Special Topics in the Humanities,"What does it mean to say something is “haunted”?  What are ghosts, and what are ghost stories good for?  What are the traditions and tropes of this kind of storytelling, and how have they changed over time?  What kinds of social, historical, or psychological crises or traumas do ghost stories, and the very idea of a “haunted house,” help us explore?  How do such stories challenge us to adjust our definitions of family, selfhood, social power, historical memory, personal transgression, and even national guilt?

In this course, we will explore a range of literary hauntings, from relatively overt ghost stories to more complex and nuanced novels of hauntedness, mostly in the Anglo-American tradition.  Readings will primarily consist of novels and related texts (short stories and the occasional poem, film, folkloric tale, and article); novels will likely include Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House, George Saunders’ Lincoln in the Bardo, Kazuo Ishiguro’s A Pale View of the Hills, and Toni Morrison’s Beloved.

A hybrid literature and creative-writing course, our primary methods will be rooted in critical analysis of assigned texts, combined with our own storytelling efforts—as yet another tool for deepening our understanding of the contours and implications of these traditions. (Students need not be advanced or experienced in both analytical and creative writing, merely open to working in both formats.)  The primary tasks of the course will be excellent preparation (by reading assigned texts with curiosity and care), active class participation, and thoughtful attention to major assignments (analytical essays, creative-writing assignments, discussion leadership, concept mapping, and related work). 

Please note:  Course readings will occasionally raise issues related to suicide, racist violence, and sexual trauma.Intended Audience:Class Format:","Matthews,Christopher",RCHUMS,334,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - On Haunting,3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Special Topics in the Humanities,"How can art be a means of resistance? Is the sheer production of art under systems of oppression an act of resistance in and of itself? How does art manage to thrive under systems of oppression? How do we judge the aesthetic and activist aspects of a work of art? This course looks at how art has been used as a form of resistance against oppression and subjugation in the broadest sense: including governmental, societal, and domestic oppression. We will examine contemporary artists and works on a global scale including artist responses to the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., May ’68 in France, Palestinian resistance since 1948, international responses to recent wars in the Middle East and other global neo-colonial interventions, global feminist, queer rights, and disability movements, among others. Students will develop skills in visual analysis, critical thinking, and academic writing. These skills will be demonstrated through in-class work, visual analysis of a work in the UMMA collection, an in-class presentation, and a final research paper on an artist, work, or resistance movement of the student’s choice.","Crasnow,Sascha M",RCHUMS,334,"Fall 2021, ",Section 005, - Art and Resistance: Global Responses to Oppression,3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

You will post your research and original poems on a blog that will also include a group podcast, for which you’ll receive plenty of technical support before launching.
The goal will be to find the proper structure and form to contain the historic material employed. You will also learn how to organize your research material for application to your own poetry and to your blogs. Don’t worry: You will need neither prior experience writing poetry nor prior experience creating a podcast or a blog to do well this semester; however, you should have had some previousstudy of poetry.

The internships involve a range of time commitments ranging from 3-5 hours per week. In addition, the class meets once a week.  
The class fosters students’ ability to apply the expressive arts as a catalyst for change in issues of social justice. Students learn how the arts are applied as healing tools in response to trauma and the impact of racism and classism on equal access to services and educational resources for youth in the United States. The internship experiences prepare students to engage in diverse settings as well as provide opportunities to communicate across differences, operate with humility, and be exposed to the realities of youth living in our community.","Gordon-Gurfinkel,Deborah Mae",RCHUMS,341,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,
Survey of Russian Literature,"

This course focuses on the masterpieces of Russian fiction written between 1820 and 1870, including such classics of world literature as Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. While his period marks a blossoming of Russian culture, relations between writers and political authorities were strained at the time. We will trace how writers treated the political, philosophical, and religious issues dividing their contemporaries. Topics include romantic love, the family, gender relations, God’s existence and humankind’s relationship to God, theodicy (the problem of evil) and human mortality, one’s ethical obligations to society and fellow humans, revolutionary violence, and religious repentance, and Russia and the West. No knowledge of Russian literature, history, or language is presupposed. Course Requirements:

Race and Identity in Music,"This course explores the parameters of racial and ethnic identities in music. From the discourse surrounding exoticism and Orientalism, to the effects of evocative instrumentation, the use of dialect, and foreign subjects, the focus of this class is to understand how racial and ethnic difference can be portrayed musically. Musical case studies will be drawn from the nineteenth century through the present with a strong emphasis on the genre of opera.  Central questions to be raised are: how is racial/ethnic difference expressed musically? Who is representing whom? What is the intersection between the original performing context and our understanding of these works today? This course encourages interdisciplinary dialogue. Readings will be drawn from post-colonial and cultural studies as well as musicology.","Andre,Naomi A",RCHUMS,354,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Race and Identity in Music,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
The Symphonic Century:  Music and Revolution in the 19th Century,"Punctured by revolutions, the 19th century was an era marked by social, political, and economic unrest. From the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century, through the multiple rebellions in 1848, the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and the instability that led to the First World War, the spirit of revolution ran strong in the 19th century. This course looks at the evolution of one of the premiere musical genres of the 19th century—the symphony—within the larger context of its time. How do the early beginnings that emphasize a strict adherence to musical form reflect the social upheaval brought on through the French Revolution? In a time of strong juxtapositions, how does the symphony articulate the aesthetics of the sublime and the beautiful, the monumental and the miniature, the public and the private, the individual and the nation? 
In this class, we will examine the symphonies of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Brahms, Mahler, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, and William Grant Still. Attention to musical form and style, composer biography and placement in music history, and contemporary musicological methodologies will be presented in a way that engages those from all musical backgrounds. Grade will be determined by class participation, and written assignments (no prerequisites required).","Andre,Naomi A",RCHUMS,356,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,Honors,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Upperclass Literature Seminar,"Ever wonder what effect cellphones and social media are having on our friendships and love lives? How so much connectivity can lead to so much loneliness? These might seem like urgent, of-the-moment questions, but writers have been contemplating them for as long as “new” communications technology has been around. To gain insight into the pleasures and perils of current usage, we will study relevant contemporary works of fiction and film. We will then turn to older works featuring such “new” distance-canceling technologies as the phonograph, radio, airplanes, and television and ask how such inventions disrupted human relationships. Which doomsday predictions have come true? Which proven to be misguided? Throughout the course, we will pay particular attention to the formal effects of communications technology, from e-mail as plot driver to video conferencing and text messages adding a new layer to the moving image. (How do directors avoid boring audiences?) Students will also have the chance to compare a “snail mail” correspondence to an electronic one.

Readings in French,"Far from being a doctrine, Existentialism is fundamentally a philosophical tendency. Born of a reaction against Hegelian rationalism, the different existentialist tendencies come together in the rehabilitation of freedom, subjectivity and individual existence. In this course we will attempt, through our readings, to discern the characteristics of various existentialist concepts. After a brief survey of the precursors and the “founders” of existentialism, we will focus on two members of what has been called the Philosophical School of Paris, namely Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir; we will also study Albert Camus. Our first readings by Jean-Paul Sartre will allow us to familiarize ourselves with the main existentialist themes. The study of Albert Camus’ conception of the human condition and the absurd will offer us a diametrically opposed perspective to Sartre’s systematic approach, and de Beauvoir’s critique of Sartre’s conception will shed new light on the concepts of freedom and responsibility.

Russian Readings,"As ever, Russia comes to the European table late but its contribution to the world arts is extraordinary.  In the last 200 years Russia has given the world striking modernist pictorial works (think Shagal, Kandinsky, Malevich), astonishing ballet (think Dyagilev and Pavlova); amazing symphonic and operatic music (think Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Rachmaninov, and Shostakovich); world-famous performers and stage directors (think Shalyapin, Rostropovich, Stanislavsky, and Meyerhold); and leading contributions to the most significant movements in modern art (think the avant-garde, socialist realism, sots-art, and postmodernism).  Yet before the18th century, Russia’s art was exclusively religious (think Rublyov, Russian icons, church music, and architecture).  How did it happen?  Who/what brought secular art to Russia?  How did it manage to raise a whole pantheon of artists in such a short time?  This course will survey the history and development of Russian visual, performing, and decorative arts, paying particular attention in the last three centuries to its major cultural and artistic figures, masterpieces, museums, and collections.   The goal of this course is to use and advance language skills by researching in depth a Russian cultural topic through course readings, video viewings, class discussions, and writing short academic essays, and giving presentations, all in Russian.","Makin,Alina Udalchenko",RCLANG,323,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Russian Art, Arts, and Artists",4,,,Proficiency in Russian (by RC standards).,,May not be repeated for credit.,

We will focus on how the negotiations between the national desire to forget a painful history and the need to preserve its memory manifest themselves in music, film, and other artistic expressions. Special emphasis will be given to the experience of exile, silence, and displacement of the older generation, and the controversial burial sites of victims and perpetrators. We will also debate the role of monuments, memorials, and public spaces as sites to preserve, forget or write alternative narratives that shed light on the contradictory experiences of collective trauma as well as the possible paths to reconciliation.","Lopez-Cotin, Olga  ",RCLANG,324,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Narratives of Memory, Oblivion and National Identity in Spain",4,,,Proficiency test.,,May be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Readings in Spanish,"Terrorism is a very important issue in many countries currently, especially in the US. Even though many people have already formed an opinion on this problem and how to solve it, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the history as well as causes and consequences of this phenomenon. This seminar will review the conditions and contexts that resulted in the formation of some terrorist organizations around the world. We will seek information from different Latin American organizations like Sendero Luminoso (Peru), FARC (Colombia), EZLN (Mexico).  An important part of the course will be the study of groups that due to their strategies could be classified as religious terrorism, such as the Christian Patriots and the Anti-Abortion Movement in the USA. Another focal point of the course will be interpreting the role and reaction of the mass media with careful analysis of the portrayal of each terrorist organization. This will lead to question the use of certain terminologies –such as “freedom fighter” versus “terrorist”— and who determines and applies these terms. Finally, students will propose a definition of terrorism and based on the information discussed in the course, determine whether the “war on terrorism” is the adequate answer from the government to this phenomenon. Documentaries will complement readings and the final evaluation will be based on student participation, three academic papers and a class presentation.","Espinoza-Pino,Cristhian Carlo",RCLANG,324,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Terrorism and the Media,4,,,Proficiency test.,,May be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Readings in Spanish,"Latin America’s complex history of colonialism has left a permanent mark on its social and structural development. Perhaps the most influential consequence of colonialism is its social stratification based on skin color. While the new republics established after their independence in the 19th century promised equal rights and opportunities for all, the social discourse and attitudes surrounding class, color, and indigenous culture rooted in colonization remain deeply internalized by citizens today. This course aims to examine social stratification in the Andean region, specifically Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, to assess the impact of colonization on the development of pigmentocracy, a social hierarchy that enforces classism and racism based on skin color perceptions. We will explore various resources to learn how these countries continue to define concepts of ethnicity, identity, and also aims to understand how the intersectionality of different social identities debilitates resistance to a pervasive system of white dominance. Furthermore, this class will also address present-day public policy and social measures to analyze their effectiveness and shortcoming in tackling practices of discrimination.","Nunez, Sandra D",RCLANG,324,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003," - Pigmentocracy, Racism and Social Stratification in Latin America",4,,,Proficiency test.,,May be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Introduction to Global Change:  The Science Behind Sustainability," Everyday, human and natural activities are altering the planet on which we live. Through our increasing resource consumption, population growth, disturbance of natural systems, and technological advancement, we are changing the global climate and environment in a manner that is unique over Earth’s history. Many of these changes are degrading the physical and biological processes that underpin Earth’s life-support systems, which poses a great challenge for society in this century.
 This course, Global Change — the Science of Sustainability, investigates the causes and impacts of these changes using a combination of traditional lecture-based and modern digital teaching methodologies. The course surveys the evolution and interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes on Earth; how past changes on Earth help us predict the future, especially with respect to climate change; and how fundamental principles of science establish the sustainability of human activities on Earth. Students apply learned knowledge by using ‘systems modeling’ and spreadsheet software to investigate the dynamics of natural systems and examine case studies of relevant environmental problems.
  The course curriculum provides excellent opportunities to conduct research on topics of interest to the students, culminating in a course project presented at the end of the academic term. The interactive laboratory exercises provide students the opportunity to use software tools to examine how natural systems function as well as develop projections of the future consequences of changes in the environment. And, perhaps most important of all, students will have ample time for discussion of critical issues in natural resources and sustainability, and the role of environmental science in policy and society as a whole. All topics are developed in a manner that students will find both accessible and interesting. After the course, students should be able to discern sound science from biased claims and will have a foundation for making informed decisions about sustainable practices in their own lives.

Topics in Social Theory and Practice,"Ever been curious about the history of crime, punishment and prisons in the United States?  What is crime? How is it counted? Why does it fluctuate? Are there important distinctions between crimes? Which is more effective, punishment or rehabilitation? How far should either go? Who should administer either? How has the administration of law and order, corrections, sentencing, parole, etc. changed over time? Does region matter? Does race, gender and/or class matter? And how is this system actually experienced by those on the inside?
Through primary and secondary source readings, as well as documentary film, this course will look closely at the history and theory of punishment, and at how prisons and detention have been used to address social ills over time in American history. It will pay close attention to the importance of historical context and political moment when considering how the judicial system as well as prison system operates, and it will assess the ways in which race, gender, class, and sexuality shape both prison politics and populations. The course will explore the importance of regional difference vis-à-vis the administration of punishment, and will also grapple with some of the questions that Americans find most troubling today with regard to crime and punishment. These include: debates over the death penalty, the law regarding youth offenders, the ethics of drug laws, prisoner civil liberties vs. victims’ rights, mandatory sentencing guidelines, and how the criminal justice system deals with the mentally ill. Finally, students will address the question of how the United States might best remedy the criminal justice problems it now faces—both in theory and in practice.","Thompson, Heather Ann",RCSSCI,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - History and Theory of Punishment,3,SS,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

This course will put this ongoing social movement into context and consider the history and current state of policing, surveillance, and carceral control in the United States. It will encourage students to think historically about how American policing has changed over time and how categories of race, gender, sexuality, immigration status, age, and class have shaped the surveillance of American communities. We will consider the roots of modern American policing and state surveillance and the role of police departments in shaping urban geographies and defending the racial borders in American cities. We will examine the long history of state violence and police brutality, attempts to reform police departments, and more radical proposals for police and prison abolition. Finally, we will consider what the history of policing and surveillance can tell us about our own contemporary moment as protests against violent, racist policing continue to arise in communities across the United States. Course assignments will include academic scholarship, journalism, multimedia exhibits, oral histories, podcasts, and films. The final project will require students to create a public multimedia presentation about protests and social justice organizing concerning carceral control or another issue. Collectively, these presentations will chronicle a wide range of efforts to make our communities more just.","Krinitsky,Nora",RCSSCI,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Policing, Power, and Protest in the United States",3,SS,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

Topics in Social Theory and Practice,"This course will explore the history of Detroit, focusing on its transformation during the twentieth century and continued evolution as a majority-black city. The course is intended to clarify how the city’s past has created the conditions and circumstances of the present. Potential topics and themes to be examined in the course include (but certainly are not limited to): the histories of indigenous peoples in the region before the founding of Detroit; practices of slavery and abolition; the persistence and impact of racial and ethnic conflicts across time periods; the ways in which class conflicts have shaped the urban landscape and the workplace; the Great Migration and the social and political development of Black communities; the impact of immigration on Detroit’s social and political development; profiles of specific neighborhoods; musical traditions such as Blues, Jazz, Motown, Techno, and Hip Hop; the interplay between the auto industry and the urban environment; the on-going struggles over political power and for control of the city; and the changing ways the city is represented, both among its citizens and in the broader American consciousness.","Jordan,Jamon Andre",RCSSCI,250,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - From the Underground to Motown: A Course on Detroit's History,3,SS,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

Social Science Theory I: From Social Contract to Oedipus Complex,"The United States faces three profound, interlocking challenges: accelerating climate change, skyrocketing economic inequality, and the deteriorating quality of our democratic institutions. How well we address these challenges over the next decade will have huge impacts on the well-being of current and future generations. Social science theory, and empirical research based on it, can help us to understand the underlying causes of these challenges.  Comparative and historical methods, applied to national-level aggregate data and to particular case studies, can be employed both to understand the causality and, based on that understanding, to assess different possible policy responses. Finally, theory and research on social movements and organizing can be used to assess strategies for building enough political power to implement the policy changes that will successfully respond to our challenges despite intense resistance from entrenched interests.  This course will examine these three challenges, applying all three types of social science analysis to each.","Robinson, Ian  ",RCSSCI,301,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Social Theory for Social Change,4,SS,,At least one 200-level social science course.,F.,May not be repeated for credit.,
Environmental Justice Grassroots Community Organizing in Detroit for Changing Times,"This course looks at movements, resistance, resilience, and liberation. Community Organizing is growing as an academic field, especially as it relates to urban studies. A growing body of evidence reveals that people of color and low-income persons have borne greater environmental and health risks than society at large in their neighborhood, workplace, and playgrounds. Over the last decade,
grassroots activists have attempted to change the way governments implement environmental and health laws.

Critical Theory in Medicine and Healing,"This writing intensive lecture course introduces upper division undergraduates to the critical anthropological analysis of illness, health, healing and medicine.  Our investigation will be comparative, examining how different systems of meaning and power make sense of bodily states, historically and cross-culturally.  We will explore current and past medical anthropological approaches — political economic, symbolic, feminist, post-structuralist — in order to critically evaluate how well these frameworks convey the lived experience of bodies in their local worlds.  The intellectual excitement of medical anthropology comes from its ability to challenge categories and boundaries that seem natural and fixed.  Ultimately, my goal is for students to think differently about the embodied relations of health and affliction as produced through the natural ""order of things"".","Roberts,Elizabeth FS",RCSSCI,327,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, SS",,One course in ANTHRCUL or RCSSCI or WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240) or WGS (WOMENSTD) with an SS designation.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
History and Theory of Punishment,"Ever been curious about the history of crime, punishment and prisons in the United States?  What is crime? How is it counted? Why does it fluctuate? Are there important distinctions between crimes? Which is more effective, punishment or rehabilitation? How far should either go? Who should administer either? How has the administration of law and order, corrections, sentencing, parole, etc. changed over time? Does region matter? Does race, gender and/or class matter? And how is this system actually experienced by those on the inside?
Through primary and secondary source readings, as well as documentary film, this course will look closely at the history and theory of punishment, and at how prisons and detention have been used to address social ills over time in American history. It will pay close attention to the importance of historical context and political moment when considering how the judicial system as well as prison system operates, and it will assess the ways in which race, gender, class, and sexuality shape both prison politics and populations. The course will explore the importance of regional difference vis-à-vis the administration of punishment, and will also grapple with some of the questions that Americans find most troubling today with regard to crime and punishment. These include: debates over the death penalty, the law regarding youth offenders, the ethics of drug laws, prisoner civil liberties vs. victims’ rights, mandatory sentencing guidelines, and how the criminal justice system deals with the mentally ill. Finally, students will address the question of how the United States might best remedy the criminal justice problems it now faces—both in theory and in practice.","Thompson, Heather Ann",RCSSCI,357,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Social Science Junior Seminar,"Facing a society with growing inequality in income, wealth, and power this course has three basic goals. The first is to understand that when workers and their families act collectively, they have the power to change society to create far greater equality and democracy.  We will focus mainly on the United States but will also look at other OECD countries to put the American experience in a comparative perspective.   Our second goal is to understand why workers’ power began to decline when it did and how the intentional use of race to divide workers and break the New Deal coalition was such a critical factor in the decline of workers’ power, equality, and democracy.  Our third goal is to explore what can be done to rebuild workers’ power, equality, and democracy—and the importance of both class and race in rebuilding worker power.   We will also examine several critiques of how (many) U.S. unions currently operate, discuss the alternatives advanced by critics, and explore the efficacy of recent and on-going innovations such as the Fight for 15 and a Union, SEIU Las Vegas, Teacher Direct Collective Actions, and Bargaining for the Common Good.","King,Robert Thompson",RCSSCI,360,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Challenging Inequality: Raising Worker Wages Dignity and Power through Collective Action, Collective Bargaining, and Race/Class Solidarity",3,SS,,Upperclass standing.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

"Excellence, Equity, and the Politics of Education","Excellence for all … or excellence for some?  Can schools function as the “great equalizer”? A reading-intensive course, this seminar focuses on the broad issue of educational equity over the past 100 years, explored within the context of the many goals of American schooling. In particular, readings and discussions will assess: 

the social distribution of educational resources, opportunities and outcomes; 
 the role of school structure and organization in reproducing and reinforcing prevailing economic, political, and social relationships; and
 the potential contradictions between the societal functions of schooling and the professed goals of educators.

Social Science Senior Seminar,"This course is the capstone for the Social Theory and Practice major in the Residential College.  Students, meeting together as a seminar, in smaller working groups, and in one-on-one sessions with the instructor and with faculty advisors, will develop and complete a senior project that fulfills the culminating requirement for the major and is personally and intellectually satisfying.  The seminar provides a structure to guide you in developing a research plan, an angle of analysis, and a line of argument in a voice that is both yours and convincing to others. Here you will also find a forum for discussion among your peers that will bring the analysis of your individual projects into conversation with the work of others. 
The exact nature of your project is for you to determine in consultation with the instructor and your primary faculty advisor.  Many of you will do a research project on some topic or theme emerging from your STP major and write a report of at least 25 pages (length will vary according to topic and methods used). Many will build research around an internship or an engagement with wider communities, contextualizing what you have done and reflecting on that experience.  It is also entirely possible to take a more creative direction – writing a play, constructing a website or a zine, creating a public exhibition or display, developing a teaching module, making a movie.  The seminar offers a structure and forum within which you will create a plan for sustained work on the project, culminating with oral presentations and final submission of a finished product in early December.

Senior Seminar,"Though activists and organizers have been fighting against the injustices in the U.S. prison system for many decades, it is only in recent years that “Mass Incarceration” and “Criminal Justice Reform” have become well-known terms. For those who want to participate in prison-related social justice efforts, however, the programs, practices, and initiatives can be confusing to parse. Common questions include:
What exactly is ""Restorative Justice"", and what does it look like in practice?
What strategies fall under the umbrella of “prison reform”, and what practices are considered “abolitionist”? Are these practices mutually exclusive, or symbiotic?
What are “alternatives to incarceration?”, and what is “decarceration?”
And finally, how can students contribute to these efforts currently as well as in their future careers?
In this class, we will co-create working definitions of these terms and explore what they look like in practice, using texts, documentaries, and insights from organizers and activists engaging in this work every day. Specifically, we will explore the work of decarceration-focused restorative justice and arts-based practitioners; policy advocates; community re-entry specialists; social workers; educators; lawyers; and others. In addition to short weekly written assignments, students will design and complete a final decarceration-related project, featuring topic(s) and a format of their choosing.

Rock Poetry and Political Protest in Poland,"


This course provides an introduction to Polish culture in the larger context of Slavic and Central European cultures through a detailed study and analysis of “music of protest” (jazz, cabaret, rock, punk) during the 1945-1989 period of Soviet dominance and during the period of transition to democracy and after the establishment of full democratic rule in Poland. This course also provides an introduction to rhetoric and contextual reading of poetry (as well as other forms of expression). We will study in detail texts by some of the most important Polish and other Central European pop, jazz, cabaret, rock, and punk authors and bands with the purpose of identifying devices and strategies used to create meanings. We will connect texts with elements of the daily lives of people in Poland (as well as other Central European nations) focusing in particular on: cultural heritage, history, politics, social issues, past and future myths (interpretations of past events and projections of perceived “national goals” into the future). We will study and discuss the “romantic pose” of rock poets (poet as a prophet —  the 19th-century concept created by Polish Romantic poets in the context of constructing art as an instrument of the Polish “battle for freedom and independence”). Specifically, we will investigate the “Polish trend” to build poetic texts on the foundation of ideas (rock poetry as an extension of discourse on ideas). We will compare Polish rock poetry to British and American rock poetry to highlight the dominance of “word and meaning” in Polish rock and punk of the 1980s and 2000s. Other topics will include: 

 totalitarian structures and poetic response to totalitarian structures, 
 the three taboos in Polish culture (communism, Catholicism, anti-communist opposition), 
 the quest for utopia,  
the “apologetic nature” of Polish art,  
the fear of and desire for diversity in Polish culture and history, 
 the construction of a “collective Polish psyche”.

 This course addresses a wide range of issues related to the study of history, literature, culture, social and cultural transformations, construction and deconstruction of national, social, and gender mythologies and perceptions. It will focus on responses to the imposition of totalitarian structures and survival within them, responses to historical changes, as well as strategies for constructing national consensus and for dealing with a diversity of ideas and attitudes. 

This course will focus on Polish culture but will do so in a global context: it will introduce the students to general and foundational concepts and ideas in communication, semiotics, rhetoric, and the reading of poetic texts. The focus on comprehension of complex synthetic art forms in a social, historical, and political context can be applied to other cultures as well (Polish, Slavic, non-Slavic, past, and contemporary). Polish culture will be analyzed in terms of its main building blocks: ethnicity, religion, gender, cultural identity, the importance of ideas and verbal communication, the opposition between the West and the East, the opposition between Enlightenment and Romanticism, opposition between faith and fact, the opposition between real and perceived continuity of history and culture. In the process, Polish culture will be defined in all its distinctiveness but with clear attention to the qualities shared with the cultures of other Slavic and Central European nations and states. Students will analyze how literary and non-literary texts (verbal and non-verbal) are constructed, how meanings are created and transmitted, how real and perceived connections between the author and the audience are developed.

  This will allow students to enhance their talents for persuasive and expository presentations and allow them to become “intentional” communicators and receivers of communication. Students will be exposed to the full range of human experiences in the face of war, human rights abuses, totalitarian rule, revolution, and political, social, and cultural transformation.Course Requirements:
Attendance; 
Regular short participation tests; 
Final exam. 
1 argumentative paper (8-12 pages). 
1 research paper (8-12 pages).
Intended Audience:Students seeking to broaden their understanding of foundational concepts in popular culture and its interaction with politics and basic strategies and devices in rhetoric/communication. Students pursuing Slavic majors/minors and seeking to expand their knowledge beyond their primary Slavic field.

REES Topics in the Humanities,"Kim Kardashian is an influential businesswoman and reality TV star. Movses Khorenatsi claimed to live in the 5th century and is known as Patmahayr-- the Father of History. What, then, does it mean to call them both Armenian? Is it possible to inhabit different worlds, and seemingly the same group, at the same time? Or, more simply: how might two people be Armenian (or Greek, or Persian, or Turkish, or American) differently?

This fast-paced course will test the limits of belonging -- and not belonging -- to a particular ethnic group, community, or culture. Together, by examining a wide array of cultural artifacts (painting, literature, history, film, music), students will learn to analyze the diversity of Armenian experiences over time.
Our readings will be paired to generate dialogue between unlikely figures. For instance, what might the classically trained 20th-century musicologist, Gomidas Vartabed, have to say about the alternative metal band System of a Down? How might the Armenian medieval epic, David of Sassoun, offer a different way of thinking about group affiliation than does modern-day nationalism? If Kardashian and Khorenatsi could meet, what would they say? Short, critical essays will accompany our investigations, helping us to think about the challenges or treating Armenian culture -- or any culture -- as a cohesive unit. Students can expect to gain a broad understanding of Armenian culture and history over the last two millennia, as well as to become sensitive readers of internal heterogeneity within other cultural contexts.","Pifer,Michael Bedrosian",REEES,230,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - From Kim Kardashian to Movses Khorenatsi: Deciphering the Armenian Experience,3,HU,,,,May be elected five times for credit.

Legacy of the Holocaust in Yugoslav Culture: How and Why We Need to Narrate the Holocaust,"

The course’s primary focus is raising awareness about the historical and global persistence of racism and politics of intolerance that informs the daily lives of citizens. The reading list consists of new writings on the Holocaust created in response to the contemporary recurrence of various forms of racism, anti-Semitism, and right-wing politics in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Students will be encouraged to think about the resurrection of racist rhetoric manifested in ethnic particularism, strong anti-Semitic sentiments, and not infrequently, official anti-Roma politics. The course also makes a necessary link with racism underlying economic or even security arguments (be it the Arizona anti-immigrant law, the dislocation of the Roma by the Serbian or British governments for reasons of urban development, the abandonment of the boat with African immigrants by the Italian Navy, or the anti-Roma laws in Slovakia quoting crime prevention).
Since the rise in racism in Europe is linked to the fall of Communism, the enlargement of the EU, global migrations, as well as a long economic crisis, students will be invited to make connections between these social processes capable of producing seismic shifts and creating the fertile soil for the dissemination of racist ideas. Students will be encouraged to explore the link between the past and present, rather than read the primary texts as monuments to the past, the past that mankind keeps vowing will never repeat. Students will be invited to think why texts about the Holocaust can be particularly instructive about the reemergence of racist ideologies that are resurrected at times of social crisis.

Finally, to answer the question of “how” we write about the Holocaust, the reading list contains very diverse narrative techniques that in strange and painful ways immerse the reader in the position of the victim. The reading list consists of primary texts about the Holocaust in Eastern Europe and the Balkans that frequently treat the subject in novel and unexpected ways. The secondary literature is composed of essays, excerpts, filmic and documentary material intended to foster discussion about racism and anti-Semitism not merely as the event of the past and firmly connected to the period of the Nazi occupation of Europe, but as a global occurrence that may and does affect our lives at present.Course Requirements:Evaluation: based on class participation, midterm presentation, final project (if paper, 10-12 pp, otherwise run your project idea with instructor prior to starting it), and the oral presentation of the project-paper, bi-weekly quizzes and weekly discussion questions.","Aleksic,Tatjana",REEES,350,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Islamic Movements in Comparative Perspective,"This course examines the rise and evolution of political and social movements that derive their distinctive identity from Islam by appealing to its foundational ideas and values and acting in its name and/or in the name of God. We will analyze the causes, origins, strategies, goals, and relations with state authorities of such movements in different areas of the Muslim world and in the countries in which Muslims constitute a substantial minority. After a brief introduction to Islam as a religious, cultural, and political tradition and social system, we will address the phenomenon of so-called “political Islam” in the modern age (late nineteenth century-present), its historical roots, and theological-juridical underpinnings. While the ideological premises shared by all the major Islamic movements are extremely important, we will focus on the diversity of political and social agendas of such movements in various regional contexts. The role of the political, social, and cyber environments (the Internet) in which regional Islamic movements evolve and operate will receive special attention. The course features a number of recent documentary films as well as sessions conducted by foreign and local guest speakers with expertise in different regional manifestations of Islamic/Islamist politics.","Knysh,Alexander D",REEES,411,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,Introductory course on Islam (i.e. NEAREAST 216).,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Buddhism and Death,"Buddhism is comprised of a complex of traditions, spanning multiple cultures over the course of more than two millennia. Despite its dizzying diversity, there are a number of unifying themes — loosely woven networks of beliefs and practices found throughout Buddhist traditions across time and space. Such themes include the problem of suffering, the goal of liberation, the authority of the Buddha, and the centrality of texts, to name just a few. The topic of this course — the role of death in Buddhism — stands alongside and in relation to other central aspects of the Buddhist tradition. Why death? From a certain perspective, conceptions and practices of dying, death, and the afterlife are the fundamental concerns of all Buddhists. How does the immanence of death influence the actions of the living? How should one die? What happens at the moment of death? What should be done with the bodies of the dead? Is there an afterlife? What is it that is reborn? We will explore these and other issues as they manifest in distinct cultural contexts (India, Thailand, China, and Japan) and as cross-cultural phenomena. In addition to assigned readings of scholarly articles and translations of primary texts, relevant topics will be addressed in class through lectures, discussions, numerous images, and films.","Brose,Benjamin",RELIGION,234,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Readings will consist largely of primary materials translated into English. The main focus of the course will be to highlight the central philosophical concepts and to ask how these ideas contribute to their respective world-views and ethical outlooks, and how they affect the religious expressions of these cultures. Asian 220 will give you the tools to think critically about the diversity of philosophical and religious traditions and ideas that exist in Asia. Students will also gain an understanding of how these philosophical ideas have been influential in shaping the religious cultures of much of Asia. The course also serves as a general introduction to philosophical thinking on a number of profound philosophical questions. What is the nature of the self? What is really real? What happens after death? What is the relationship between the individual and society? The course also aims to develop the student’s skills in reading, writing, and critical thinking.","Mandair,Arvind-Pal Singh",RELIGION,262,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
The Land of Israel/Palestine through the Ages,"This course explores the region of the Middle East known as Israel by some and Palestine by others. It outlines the historical events that occurred in that territory from the earliest days of the past to the present, analyzes the various factors (political, economic, cultural, and religious) that shaped its development, and introduces empires and nations that ruled the land as well as the people who inhabited its cities and villages. The course will pay careful attention to matters related to issues of Race and Ethnicity; the volatile story of this land will here serve as a laboratory for examining the interrelation between race, ethnicity, and religion across three millennia.","Eliav,Yaron Z",RELIGION,277,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.,
"The Historical Jesus in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam","Everybody thinks they know Jesus, but who was he, really? What did he do? Who did he claim to be? What kind of a Jew was he? How did he become the founder of a new religion? The course focuses on the Jewish religious leader and messianic claimant, and founder of the Christian movement, Jesus of Nazareth (Jesus son of Joseph, Joshua bar-Yosef, Isa), as a historical character. By examining all extant historical sources (Jewish, Christian, and Islamic), the course offers a critical reconstruction of the major stages of the life and deeds of the prophet from Nazareth, from his birth under Herod the Great to his death and crucifixion under Pontius Pilate, within the diverse world of Second Temple Judaism. In particular, the course explores the ever-changing interpretations of Jesus in modern and contemporary Christianity, Judaism, and Islam to the present.","Zurawski,Jason M",RELIGION,280,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
The Moving Image in the Middle Ages,"Byzantine art has been both condemned and praised for its static nature and flat surfaces. This course examines contexts in which the Byzantine icon disproves the traditional notion (or burden) of stillness imposed upon it. These contexts range from the public arena of processions in which icons (images) were the center of visual attention, to the walls of Byzantine churches and palaces where they performed, to the miracles in which they supposedly came ""alive"". The responses of Byzantine viewers also reveal modes in which the viewing process shook icons out of their boundaries, transforming, even distorting them. By examining these issues, we may begin to understand the nuanced nature of the Byzantine icon other than as an epitome of stillness. The readings for this course include primary sources (all translated) in the form of deliciously evocative poems, epigrams, and sermons.","Chatterjee,Paroma",RELIGION,346,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
History and Religion of Second Temple Judaism,"Evil. Why does it exist? How can a good God allow bad things to happen to good people? This is the question of theodicy, a problem that has plagued philosophers, theologians, and thinkers of all sorts for thousands of years. It is a question which has spurred more religious and spiritual innovation than perhaps any other. The answers developed to deal with such a profound problem are tied to the development of, for example, monotheism, messianism, the devil, heaven and hell, and many others. In this course, we will explore a fascinating and dynamic period of Jewish history: the Persian, Hellenistic, and early Roman eras, the time from which Judaism and Christianity as we know them today will emerge. We will explore the history of the period along with its extremely diverse body of literature, many texts of which fall outside standard religious canons but which were indeed canonical to those who read and used them, texts like the Dead Sea Scrolls. In this review, we will pay particular attention to the question of theodicy and the problem of evil and how it impacted nearly every major ideological and practical development we find from this period. From this class, we will discover just how profound an effect the question of evil had not only during the Second Temple period but on culture and civilization to this very day.","Zurawski,Jason M",RELIGION,359,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Theodicy and the Problem of Evil,3,HU,,,,May be elected three times for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.

Indian Religions and Western Thought,"This course examines the intellectual and cultural encounter between India and the West from the 1770s to the present day, a period that coincides with the entry of India into the historical experience of colonialism and modernity. It looks at how the discovery of knowledge about India affected debates in modern European philosophy and conversely examines the reception of European ideas in modern Indian thought. One of the outcomes of this encounter is that national culture in India and Europe developed in relation to a shared experience of colonialism in which notions of religion and secularity were crucial in evolving the idea of the nation in both regions. This course will examine how Western discourses of race, religion, secularity, gender, and spirituality were internalized by Indian elites and eventually deployed in the formation of socio-political and religious movements of reform and anti-colonial resistance. We shall look at how these reform movements shaped the nationalization of three distinct communities in colonial North India - Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh – and how encounters between these communities and the British helped to define some of the central problems of Indian democracy today.","Mandair,Arvind-Pal Singh",RELIGION,400,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,Junior and above.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Religion,"What is the role of children, boys and girls, in Judaism? Although the religious education of children in the family has always been a major concern in Judaism, children are rarely presented as role models in the Hebrew Bible. Since Hellenistic-Roman times (in Second Temple Judaism and the New Testament) we can see more attention being paid to children, which led Jews (and Christians) to stress the importance of schooling and formal education even outside the family. Children however were not recognized as autonomous until the nineteenth century, when Jews and Christians in Europe and the United States got involved in the general cultural debate on children's rights, which also led to the establishment of the first youth organizations. The course will focus in particular on the ""ideal"" role that Jews attributed to children based on their reading and rereading of ancient scriptures, and on the Holocaust as a very special chapter in the experience of the Jewish child, when thousands of children in total abandonment found themselves forced to take their destiny in their own hands, in the struggle to survive, in hiding, in ghettoes or concentration camps.","

Islamic Intellectual History,"After examining Islam as a concept (or, rather, an array of different conceptualizations), a subject of academic inquiry, and an intellectual challenge (in terms of defining what is included into and excluded from this elastic category), we will undertake a comparative exploration of Islamic discursive theology (kalam), legal theory (fiqh), philosophy (falsafa), and modern-day Islamic reformism (islah) and “fundamentalism” (Salafism; salafiyya). We will pay special attention to the question of how these diverse fields of intellectual endeavor – varying in methodology and purpose – have conceived of God and his relationship with the world he created, especially the world of human beings. Islamic doctrines and practices have always evolved within concrete socio-political circumstances that decisively, if indirectly, shaped their evolution across time and space. Recent and current debates inside and outside the Muslim world over current and future directions of Islamic thought and practice, as well as the burning geopolitical issues faced by the global Muslim community (umma), will be discussed in detail. Last, but not least, we will evaluate the usefulness and suitability of recent Western sociological, hermeneutic, and anthropological methodologies in explaining the intellectual, ritual, and spiritual aspects of the life of the umma. We will also attempt to formulate and propose new, original ways of approaching the complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that we call “Islam.”","Knysh,Alexander D",RELIGION,461,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,ULWR,,Taught in English.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Senior Seminar in Romance Languages and Literatures,"Before there was Covid-19, there was AIDS. In fact, even though life-prolonging therapies have been available since 1996, approximately 700,000 people worldwide died of HIV-related illnesses in 2019, and 1.7 million became infected that year. In this course, we will focus primarily on the first 15 years of the known epidemic in Europe, Africa, and Latin America, where the pandemic saw a surge of public discourses and counter-discourses that shaped how the crisis ultimately unfolded. Drawing from very diverse sources, we will analyze how scientific, political, and popular representations of AIDS often recycled existing racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and ableist tropes in order to exclude people most affected by the virus and reinforce the very forms of social exclusions that made them especially vulnerable in the first place. We will also look at resistant representations in literature and the visual arts and at the radically new forms of community-based activism that emerged at the time. Finally, we will reflect on how the AIDS crisis is being remembered (or not) today and what it can tell us about the pandemic we are now living through. Beyond the specifics of HIV/AIDS, our conversations will give us opportunities to reflect on the intersection of health and politics, the experience of social vulnerability, the power of grassroots activism, and the contested production of minority histories.","Caron,David",ROMLANG,498,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - AIDS, the Other Pandemic",3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

"Programs, Information and People","Introduction to programming with a focus on applications in informatics. Covers the
fundamental elements of a modern programming language and how to access data on the
Internet. Explores how humans and technology complement one another, including
techniques used to coordinate groups of people working together on software development.

This course is the first in a two-course sequence introducing students to programming and
the culture of programming, with a focus on applications for people, by people, and about
people. For people means applications for end-users or analysts, as opposed to back-end
or infrastructure software. By and about people refers to processing data traces of people’s
actions and interactions.

Detailed Learning Objectives. 
At the end of this course, students should be able to:

 Discuss the ways that people and computers are the same and ways that they are
different as information processors
 Describe how open source software projects are typically organized and some of the
advantages and disadvantages of that organizational form
 Describe the relationship between redundancy and compression
 Understand the following programming concepts:
     
 Data types
       Variables
       Functions
       Conditional statements
       Iteration
       List and dictionary data structures
       List comprehensions
       Regular expressions
       APIs
     
  Write programs in python that demonstrate understanding of all of the above
concepts and that use the following features:
     
 File operations
      String processing operations
      External modules and APIs
     
  Manipulate data to:
     
Extract and summarize desired elements
      Output the processed data in .csv formats
     
  Create a test suite for a simple program

Textbooks and Notes.
We will be using a custom version of the interactive, online textbook below. I will be
editing and reorganizing it to fit our curriculum. But you can get a sense for it now.

Other Required Readings


Christian, B., The Most Human Human, 2011, London, England: Viking.
Weber, S. The Success of Open Source, 2005, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press
Course Requirements:Assignments
There will be assignments throughout the course (pretty much every week and sometimes
mini exercises during a lecture). Regular assignments allow you to learn the material in
small ""chunks"" and to keep a close eye on how well you understand the material. In some
cases, we will do part or all of the assignments during a lecture, though you will submit it
later.
Exams
There will be a midterm and a final exam. The midterm exam is administered during the
regular lecture session and the final during the final exam period. The exam dates are
announced well in advance (see the dates at the end of this document). If you have a
conflict, please let me know at least 2 weeks in advance so that I can arrange a different
time for you.
Class Participation (Bonus Points)
Class participation, helping others, interacting on the Q&A site and answering questions,
asking good questions that lead to interesting discussions, and pointing out corrections to
my lectures or code will contribute to bonus points, which you can use to help boost your
grade.
Python Challenge
There are optional challenge problems at www.pythonchallenge.com. I encourage
you to try to solve the problems there when you have time and discuss approaches or even
code on the email list —  that all contributes to class participation points. If you are not able to
solve them initially, don’t worry. Treat them as optional and a fun part of the course. The
good thing about the Python challenges is that once you submit a solution to a challenge,
you can see several solutions to the previous challenge. It is a learning experience to see
how other people approached the same problem.

Grading
The graded work in the course will be weighted roughly as follows to determine a final
percentage grade. (Note that bonus points could allow you to get above 100%):

Weekly Assignments 30%
Class prep (online exercises) 10%
Discussion section prep and participation 5%
Exams: 40% (Midterm: 15% and
Final: 25%)

Capstone project: 15%
Helping other students: (helpful questions or answers in lecture
or on Facebook group)
Up to 2% bonus points
Intended Audience:The course is designed for students with no programming experience. If you stick with the
course and invest the necessary time, you will be amazed at how much you will learn in 14
weeks. Don’t be intimidated by the few students who already know how to program.
They’re welcome in the course, but the course is not designed for them.

If you do not have any programming experience, some concepts will take some time to sink
in.Class Format:We will be using a partially “flipped” classroom. It is expected that you will read and attempt
exercises before class. To do this well, you will generally need to allocate about 2 hours of
prep time before each lecture session.

During the official lecture time, we will review tricky points and difficult exercises, solve
some more additional problems together, have supervised time working individually on the
graded homework, and get a preview of the next session’s material.
During the section meetings, you will discuss the non-programming readings (Most Human
Human; Success of Open Source) and occasionally have more supervised time working
individually on the graded homework. You will need to allocate about 1 hour of reading time
each week.

If you are doing the 4 hours of prep time weekly, you will often be able to complete the
graded homeworks in class, or with 1-2 additional hours outside of class. If you don’t do the
prep before class, you will lose much of the benefit of the class time, and will end up
spending more total time trying to catch up in order to do the homework. You will also lose
the points for prep, so it will hurt your grade directly.","Oney, Steve  ",SI,106,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,MSA,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Introduction to Information Studies,"Are we in the midst of an Information Revolution? Is the Information Age essentially different from other periods in history and if so, how? What role does Information, and the myriad systems for processing and disseminating Information, play in individual lives, or in society as a whole? How can we build effective Information Systems to accomplish important goals such as facilitating commerce, fostering civic participation, and supporting human relationships? This course will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to begin to address the key issues associated with Information and its impact on human lives. Issues will range from the theoretical (what is Information, and how do humans construct it?), to the cultural (is life on the screen a qualitatively different phenomenon from experiences with earlier distance-shrinking and knowledge-building technologies such as telephones?), to the practical (what are the basic architectures of computing and networks?). Successful completion of this ""gateway"" course will give you the conceptual tools necessary to understand the politics, economics, and culture of the Information Age, providing a foundation for later study in Information or a valuable complement to studies in other disciplines.","Lampe, Cliff  ",SI,110,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Models of Social Information Processing,"This course focuses on how social groups form, interact, and change. We look at the technical structures of social networks and explore how individual actions are combined to produce collective effects. This course introduces two conceptual models for how information flows is used in multi-person settings -- networks and games. Networks describe the structure of connections among people or documents. They permit mathematical analysis and meaningful visualizations that highlight different roles played by different people or documents, as well as features of the collection as a whole. Games describe the actions available to different people and how each person’s outcomes are contingent on the choices of others. They permit
analysis of stable sets of choices by all players (equilibrium) and provide a framework for the analysis of the theoretical effects of alternative designs for markets and information elicitation mechanisms. The techniques learned in this course can provide a high level understanding of systems like Facebook,
recommender systems used in sites such as Netflix, auction systems such as Ebay, and information networks used by search engines such as Google.","Romero,Daniel M",SI,301,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,,,EECS 280.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation,"Any product—whether a website, a technological system, or an electronically mediated service—benefits from
evaluation before, during, and after the development cycle. Too often, the people who use a product cannot find
what they want or accomplish what they need to do. Products are more successful when they are developed through
a process that identifies how the products will be used, elicits input from potential users, and watches how the
products function in real time with real users. This course provides a hands-on introduction to methods used
throughout the entire evaluation process—from identifying the goals of the product, picturing who will use it,
engaging users through a variety of formative evaluation techniques, and confirming a product’s function through
usability testing and summative evaluation. Specific methods include personas and scenarios, competitive analysis,
observation, surveys, interviews, data analysis, heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and task analysis. Students
will work on group projects that apply these techniques to real products in use or development.

Goals of the Course

In this course, you will learn how to evaluate interactive software products—focusing on social computing services
—through hands-on experience with a range of methods and design issues, including: Comparison of the features
and usability of your system with the competition (competitive analysis) In-depth analysis of user needs
(observation and ethnographic methods) Asking users about their opinions and experiences (interviews and surveys)
Embodying a set of target users and what they would want to do with the system (personas and scenarios) Using
checklists and “heuristics” to evaluate the system from several points of view (heuristic evaluation, cognitive
walkthroughs, card sorting) Doing user testing of typical tasks on the system (usability testing) Improving details of
the user interface (design considerations) Monitoring and testing the design of a system after release to the public
(experiments, log analysis) Working with a larger development team (real world issues) This course integrates
learning and doing. I will give you background on the methods (through reading), teach the methods (in class), have
you try them out (in class or on your own), and you will apply these techniques to practice projects with your
classmates. For many of the methods, you will turn in a report styled like the ones given directly to developers. This
way you learn to write the reports in a way that is most useful in your future career. As you learn about these
methods, you will have opportunities to reflect on the appropriate circumstances for using each of them.","Marcu,Gabriela",SI,422,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Online Communities:  Analysis and Design of Online Interaction,"This course is intended to help students understand and analyze communities that are formed in or maintained via online environments. Although there is a fair bit of disagreement about the definition of community (and therefore, online community), we will loosely use ‘community’ as a term to describe a group of people who engage in sustained interaction over time. The group may be held together by a common identity, a collective purpose, or merely by the individual utility gained from the interactions. We
will use the terms e-community and online community interchangeably, as shorthand, both for communities that conduct all of their interactions online and for communities that use online interaction to supplement face-to-face interactions. The course introduces students to important concepts, terms, and theories that will help them understand how online communities are used by millions of people every day for a variety of purposes. The course develops a language for discussing online communities critically, and applying those concepts to new designs. The major component of this class is a group project where students apply the readings, theories, and empirical findings from the class to critique an existing online community or design a new one.","Ellison,Nicole",SI,429,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Central European Cinema,"

During four decades of Communist Party rule, the film industries of Central Europe were under state control. One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics. In certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in Central Europe were able to be more incisive, frank, and provocative than is often the case in profit-driven Hollywood film. Talented and committed filmmakers were able to take advantage of their regimes’ progressive official pronouncements with regard to ethnic and gender issues to craft powerful films which the regimes had no grounds to suppress. That legacy has carried on since the collapse of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, albeit uneasily, as new generations of filmmakers have delved into persistently troubling questions about the region’s past and present. In this course, we will examine the prewar roots of this tradition of critical filmmaking, its development through the Communist period, and how it has continued after the collapse of Communism. We will view and discuss fifteen films in chronological order (by production year) and consider their artistic structure—that is, how they go about transmitting their themes with power and emotion. We will use our developing sophistication in reading the films’ techniques to analyze what these films say about the intersecting themes of race, ethnicity, and gender during periods of social transition and crisis. There are no prerequisites. No knowledge of foreign languages is required. All readings and lectures will be conducted in English.","Paloff,Benjamin B",SLAVIC,312,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, HU, RE",,A knowledge of Russian is not required.,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.,

"Seminar in Cultural Studies of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe","

The interdisciplinary study of collective memory has been marked by debates over the status of commemorative technologies: literary, visual, temporal, architectural, institutional, and others.  Do these technologies compensate for the inability of individuals and collectives to remember “on their own,” or are they fundamental prostheses of remembrance, crucial to the labor of memory? In this seminar, we will pose remembering subjects and technologies of remembrance as mutually-constituting and historically enmeshed phenomena, neither understandable in isolation from the other. The seminar will focus on heritage, monuments, and ruins as three “technologies of memory,” at once shaping and shaped by collective projects of historical recall.  The seminar will also attempt to critique the moralizing preservationist gaze on memory objects that remains a dominant perspective on those objects, in public culture and scholarship alike; a number of alternative gazes on memory objects will be offered in order to provide you with other approaches to the study of heritage, monuments, ruins, as well as other technologies of memory.

This course will be divided into three sections: (1) an introduction to sociology as a discipline and mindset, using Allan Johnson’s book, The Forest and the Trees, 3e; (2) the history of sociology – its key figures and the major concepts that have occupied the field over the past century and a half, using Fred Pampel’s book, Sociological Lives, and Ideas; and (3) a sample of contemporary issues addressed by sociology, based on a series of articles available on the course website.


Note that students should only take ONE prerequisite course (SOC 100, 102, 300, or 302); no credit will be granted for the second prerequisite course taken (the second course will have a “Not For Credit” designation on the transcript).

Introduction to Sociology:  Special Topics,"This course reviews major issues and theoretical perspectives in the sociological study of crime and the criminal justice system. Criminal justice is a big topic that can be broadly conceptualized as society’s response to crime and the institutions through which this happens. It includes legislative bodies that create laws, law enforcement agencies, courts, corrections (jails, prison, probation, and parole), and some aspects of community services.

The goal of this course is to give students the foundation of theory, methods, and substantive knowledge necessary to develop informed perspectives on criminality, crime policy, and the social consequences of crime and punishment.  A wide range of topics will be covered. You will learn about perspectives on law, deviance and crime, justice, penal social control, and the key criminal justice institutions. Emphasis will be placed on how the criminal justice system operates, the different challenges facing the criminal justice system, the ways in which these challenges may be addressed, and how justice and morality guide the criminal justice system.

By the end of this course you will be able to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the main issues that are directly relevant to criminal justice theory and research. You will also better understand the fact and fiction in media portrayals and public stereotypes of crime and criminals, the assumptions behind different forms of punishment and other public policies related to crime, and how politicians think about and react to crime.

First Year Seminar in Sociology,"This course peers into the lives of Americans through intensive analysis of their memoirs.

Sociology of Culture,"From the Kennedys to the Kardashians: A Sociological Analysis of Culture and Consumption in the United States""

This course analyzes the manner in which the relationship between culture and consumption has transformed in the United States in the aftermath of World War II to the present. When the United States started to emerge as a superpower in the late 1950s and early 1960s, a process accompanied by the Cold War, the Kennedys became cultural icons. In the current post-Cold War era, they seem to have been replaced by the Kardashians. What does this transformation indicate in terms of the relationship between culture and consumption?","Gocek,Fatma Muge",SOC,240,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,Sustain,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Topics in Sociology,"Facing a society with growing inequality in income, wealth, and power this course has three basic goals. The first is to understand that when workers and their families act collectively, they have the power to change society to create far greater equality and democracy.  We will focus mainly on the United States but will also look at other OECD countries to put the American experience in a comparative perspective.   Our second goal is to understand why workers’ power began to decline when it did and how the intentional use of race to divide workers and break the New Deal coalition was such a critical factor in the decline of workers’ power, equality, and democracy.  Our third goal is to explore what can be done to rebuild workers’ power, equality, and democracy—and the importance of both class and race in rebuilding worker power.   We will also examine several critiques of how (many) U.S. unions currently operate, discuss the alternatives advanced by critics, and explore the efficacy of recent and on-going innovations such as the Fight for 15 and a Union, SEIU Las Vegas, Teacher Direct Collective Actions, and Bargaining for the Common Good.","King,Robert Thompson",SOC,295,"Fall 2021, ",Section 004," - Challenging Inequality: Raising Worker Wages Dignity and Power through Collective Action, Collective Bargaining, and Race/Class Solidarity",3,SS,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

Race and Ethnic Relations,"This course examines the central tensions underlying race and ethnic relations in the United States. For more than sixty years, sociologists have been preoccupied with the study of inter-group relations, assimilation, and racial and ethnic conflict. Indeed these issues have grown more complex and nuanced as the United States becomes more racially and ethnically diverse.  Our goal is to examine the social processes that facilitate or impede inter-group relations. We will devote attention to:

 theoretical debates in the conceptualization and analysis of race and ethnicity 
  developing a historical understanding of the antecedents of society’s most pressing social problems
  analyzing how various racial and ethnic groups construct and use their social identity.

American Immigration,"That America is a nation of immigrants is one of the most common, yet truest, of statements. In this course we will survey a vast range of the American immigrant experience: that of the Irish, Germans, Jews, Italians, Chinese, Japanese, Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Mexicans. Immigration to America can be broadly understood as consisting of four major waves:


the first one, that which consisted of Northwest Europeans who immigrated up to the mid-19th century

the second one, that which consisted of Southern and East Europeans at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th
the third one, the movement from the south to the north of Black Americans and Mexicans precipitated by the two world wars
the fourth one, from 1965 on, is still ongoing in the present, of immigrants mostly from Latin America and Asia.



At all times, our effort is to understand the immigrant past of these ethnic groups, both for what it tells us about the past as well as their present and possible future.Course Requirements:
            The requirements for this class consist of two essay exams (blue books, in class) comparing and contrasting a couple of immigrant groups along an important issue; and a final  research paper (about 20-25 pages long), both drawing from lectures and readings.
 
            In the research paper the topic is your family’s history as the immigrant social history of a particular ethnic/racial group that unfolded over the course of a number of generations.  The central question that will help guide you is whether the experience of your own family was typical or not. The paper should tell your family’s story as an immigrant family, 1) assessing the reasons for their migration to the U.S. as well as 2) the extent to which they experienced cultural and structural assimilation in America.
 
Both the exams will be in-class tests, consisting of one essay and a few short-answer questions that will draw from the lectures, the documentaries, and the discussion of the readings.

Introduction to Sociological Theory,"This course is an introduction to sociological theory. Part I focuses on classical social theorists—theorists that sociologists today consider as forming the canonical backbone of their discipline. We will discuss these theorists’ texts as reflecting and responding to a historical period of dramatic social change, which completely shook the fundamentals of the world these theorists knew. This period is modernity. Each of the theorists we will read had a different explanation for where and why modernity occurred, what it meant, and where it would go. Our goal in Part I will be to contrast these theorists’ different accounts of the rise of modernity and of social change more generally.


Part II will deal with the relationship between self and society. In an individualistic society such as the U.S., people often take individual agency for granted. Sociologists don’t; we problematize individualism and see agency and selfhood as outcomes of a social process. Our readings and discussions in part II will take the relationship between the individual self and society as a lens through which we can examine race, gender, and global political and economic domination. We will look at how the modernist vision of the empowered individual who can make and change history gives way to a reality where subjectivity in its numerous forms embodies domination and maybe a source of social stasis and reproduction.

Social Science Theory I: From Social Contract to Oedipus Complex,"The United States faces three profound, interlocking challenges: accelerating climate change, skyrocketing economic inequality, and the deteriorating quality of our democratic institutions. How well we address these challenges over the next decade will have huge impacts on the well-being of current and future generations. Social science theory, and empirical research based on it, can help us to understand the underlying causes of these challenges.  Comparative and historical methods, applied to national-level aggregate data and to particular case studies, can be employed both to understand the causality and, based on that understanding, to assess different possible policy responses. Finally, theory and research on social movements and organizing can be used to assess strategies for building enough political power to implement the policy changes that will successfully respond to our challenges despite intense resistance from entrenched interests.  This course will examine these three challenges, applying all three types of social science analysis to each.","Robinson, Ian  ",SOC,313,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Social Theory for Social Change,4,SS,,At least one 200-level social science course.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Social scientific theories of sexuality are considered, and historical accounts of sexual practices are reviewed. Other topics include the emergence and elaboration of forms of sexual desire (“sexualities” or categories of sexual orientation/preference), sexual subcultures and communities; relationships between sexual identity and sexual behavior; sexual hierarchies; sexual ethics; the political manipulation of sexuality; the institutional nature of heterosexuality; and how sexuality as a social institution intersects with hierarchies of race, class, and gender.","McGann, PJ  ",SOC,345,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,One introductory course in Sociology.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Law and Society,"This course explores many of the major issues and debates in the sociology of law.   Topics include theoretical perspectives on the connection between law and society; explanations for legal compliance, deviance, and resistance; the relationship between “law on the books” and “law in action”; the relationship between law and social change; and law’s ubiquitous role in popular culture.  The class emphasizes a critical examination of the factors that influence who mobilizes the law (and who doesn’t), who benefits from the mobilization of law (and who doesn’t), and what it means to “use” law in contexts other than courtrooms, such as in families, neighborhoods, workplaces, social movements, and mass media.

Criminology,"This course provides an introduction to the sociological study of crime, criminality, and criminal victimization. The course begins with analysis of differing definitions of 'crime', the problematic nature of criminal statistics, media depictions of crime, and crime myths.  We then review some of the major theoretical explanations of crime. The last section of the course explores specific types of crime, including violent interpersonal, conventional property, ""public order"",  and white collar. The patterning of crime, criminality, and victimization  by race, class, gender, and sexuality is attended to throughout the course.","McGann, PJ  ",SOC,368,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,One introductory course in sociology.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Sports, Politics, and Society","Few things have characterized mass culture in the 20th century more consistently and thoroughly than sports. Particularly in their team variety, there is not one industrial country in the world that does not possess at least one major team sport which has attained hegemonic dimensions in that country’s culture in the course of the previous century. There can simply be no doubt that team sports as a form of mass culture have been among the most essential ingredients of public life in the 20th century. If anything, their cultural importance has increased in the beginning years of the 21st. Indeed, all indications are that this importance will grow in years to come. Why has this been the case? And how did this happen? Moreover, why did the United States deviate from much of the rest of the industrial world not in terms of the presence of such sports, but in their number and kind? Briefly put, why are baseball, football, and basketball (as well as ice hockey to a certain extent) the hegemonic team sports that defined American mass culture throughout the 20th century whereas no other industrial country has more than two such hegemonic team sports, most often indeed only one — soccer? Why has this sports map remained so stable throughout a highly volatile and ever-changing century? Will this stability persist into the new millennium or will new forces challenge these hegemonic sports and contest them in their respective cultural space? Will the United States become a major soccer power and will Americans be glued to events in this sport as they have been in those of baseball, football, basketball, and hockey for many decades? And, conversely, will soccer-obsessed Europeans come to love basketball and other American sports as much as they have loved soccer? Lastly, will China incorporate both sports cultures and excel at one or the other — or even both — eventually surpassing its American and European teachers? And what about the massive proliferation of video-based and Internet-driven sports phenomena that are scrambling all of the aforementioned phenomena?","Markovits,Andrei S",SOC,379,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, SS",,One introductory course in sociology or political science.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

We examine their contrasting social characteristics (social class of origin, race/ethnicity, gender, legal status) that are the result of their different reasons for migration; different processes of incorporation; and different social outcomes in the U. S.  We particularly look at the various histories that led them to come to the U.S., the impact the legal system had on their processes of incorporation (as undocumented migrants vs. refugees vs. professional migrants), and the opportunities available to them in various regions of the country during the historical moment when they arrived in the U.S. ""","Pedraza,Silvia",SOC,404,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,RE,,Upperclass standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of department.

How does the structure of organizations and occupations perpetuate social inequalities? How does the definition—and exploitation—of “labor” differ across different industries? How do workers balance work with other family demands and empower themselves and others to make work more responsive to the needs of workers?

But gender is also a cultural and structural system that differentiates members of society. At both the individual and institutional levels, gender intersects with race, class, and sexuality to structure identities, rights, privileges, and opportunities. Organized around investigation of the socially produced North American binary gender order, this course is an introduction to the sociological study of gender that focuses on gender as embedded in social life. Specific topics of study include gender identity, how children and adults ""become"" gendered and ""do"" their gender(s), gender as a symbolic system, gender and sport, desire and gender, trans, and intersex.","McGann, PJ  ",SOC,447,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,One introductory course in SOC or WGS.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Social Change,"Economic globalization is one of the most powerful drivers of social change in the contemporary world.  Global economic integration has been underway for at least 500 years, but that process took a new turn in the 1980s.  In this course, we’ll focus on the causes and consequences of this new turn, which we’ll call the neoliberal model of economic globalization.  We’ll also ask what it would take to change that model, and with it, the dynamics of economic globalization.  The course is divided into three parts.  In Part 1, we’ll begin with the international institutions and rules -- above all, the neoliberal free trade agreements of the 1990s -- that shape neoliberal globalization.   We’ll look at the origins of these agreements, with particular attention to the prototypical North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the political struggles surrounding it.  We’ll also examine the process by which other countries – particularly France and Germany -- in which corporate cultural and political power was less unbalanced than it is in the USA nevertheless agreed to participate in the neoliberal model of global economic regulation.  Part 2 of the course will assess three debates about the consequences of neoliberal globalization: (1) has it created a “race to the bottom” for the wages, working conditions, and levels of organization of workers in the global North and the global South? (2) has it eroded the capacity of democratic national governments to regulate and redistribute?  (3) has it exacerbated global climate change?  In Part 3 of the course, we’ll ask two questions about alternatives to neoliberal globalization.  First, can economic globalization be made just and sustainable through changes to the rules and institutions of international trade, and if so, how?  Second, what are the prospects for the shift in the balance of political power – in the United States in particular -- that would be necessary to bring about the required changes in institutions and policy?","Robinson, Ian  ",SOC,460,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

We will also touch on controversial topics such as medical experimentation, the role of the patient, and ethical medical decision-making. This class will give you a new perspective on medicine to see it not only as a practice for making sick bodies well, but also for maintaining social control, establishing ideas of human worth, and even a new kind of citizenship.","Kelley,Andrea",SOC,475,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,,,One introductory course in sociology.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Topics in Sociology,"“Capitalism” describes a market-based system for organizing economic life that at present encompasses most of the globe. It is both a worldview and a set of institutional practices, and it has permeated the structure of modern society so deeply that we tend to take it for granted. But how does capitalism really work? And how well does capitalism, as currently configured, meet human needs? Could it be made to work better, and perhaps to serve different purposes? This course offers a nuts-and-bolts examination of how capitalism operates, as well as a critical reimagining of how this system could perhaps be reformed in the interest of achieving some vision of economic justice. We focus our exploration of capitalism as a social system on three problem areas: economic concentration (i.e., the power of companies like Amazon and Google), digital technologies and surveillance, and climate change.","Krippner,Greta R",SOC,495,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - Economic Justice: A Citizen's Guide to Capitalism,3,,,One introductory course in Sociology.,,May be elected three times for credit.

Topics in Sociology,"Though activists and organizers have been fighting against the injustices in the U.S. prison system for many decades, it is only in recent years that “Mass Incarceration” and “Criminal Justice Reform” have become well-known terms. For those who want to participate in prison-related social justice efforts, however, the programs, practices, and initiatives can be confusing to parse. Common questions include:
What exactly is ""Restorative Justice"", and what does it look like in practice?
What strategies fall under the umbrella of “prison reform”, and what practices are considered “abolitionist”? Are these practices mutually exclusive, or symbiotic?
What are “alternatives to incarceration?”, and what is “decarceration?”
And finally, how can students contribute to these efforts currently as well as in their future careers?
In this class, we will co-create working definitions of these terms and explore what they look like in practice, using texts, documentaries, and insights from organizers and activists engaging in this work every day. Specifically, we will explore the work of decarceration-focused restorative justice and arts-based practitioners; policy advocates; community re-entry specialists; social workers; educators; lawyers; and others. In addition to short weekly written assignments, students will design and complete a final decarceration-related project, featuring topic(s) and a format of their choosing.

We will explore the structural and cultural conditions that increase the likelihood of misconduct, as well as the steps that organizations can take to prevent such behavior. While some misconduct discussed in the course is the result of greed or the desire to do harm, we will also consider how wrongdoing can be unintentional or a product of benign organizational practices that can be avoided.

Topics in Hispanic Studies,"What ideas and tropes constitute our image of rural lives and communities? How are the views on the countryside as a place both of ""tradition"" and ""backwardness"" reconciled? How do these ideas constitute the identities of dwellers in rural areas and cities alike? This course will address these questions through the case study of 20th century Spain. While the Spanish countryside stands as one of the most persistent tropes in national culture as a symbol of pride and national identity, this century-long process of internal migration in Spain has resulted in a progressive depopulation of rural areas and the concentration of 90% of Spaniards in just 30% of urban areas. With that in mind, our course will study how literary, filmic, and visual works have examined questions of migration, gender, class, and race in relation to the depopulation of the Spanish countryside. Moreover, this course aims at offering you ample opportunities to develop the analytical and writing skills necessary to support your investigation into how Spanish cultural production has considered rural life, internal migration, the social and natural landscape of the nation, and the formation of personal and collective identities.

Topics in Hispano/Islamic/Sephardic Cultures,"This course will involve a comparative study of the representation of Islam and Muslims by non-Muslim writers in medieval and early-modern literature, mostly from the Iberian peninsula. We will look in-depth at the changing ways that Muslims appear from the early complaints of Alvarus of Córdoba, the depictions of Muslims as warriors in the Poema de Mio Cid, the polemical images in anti-Muslim polemical writings, the images of Muslims as musicians, invaders, and converts in the Cantigas de Santa María of king Alfonso X, el Sabio, and others. We will also include the shifting images of Muslims in Romancero songs, and follow the development of such images into the sixteenth century with Pérez de hita’s Guerras civiles de Granada, the novela morisca and El Abencerraje, and the immortal image of Cide Hamete, the purported Muslim author of Cervantes’ Don Quijote. We will link these shifting representations to the local, political, religious, and economic circumstances that inspired them and explore the porous and often invisible boundary between praise and polemic.","Szpiech, Ryan  ",SPANISH,375,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Race and the Representation of Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern Spanish Literature,3,"RE, HU",,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Race and Ethnicity in the Hispanic World,"This course will explore reggaetón culture through the study of language.

We will seek to answer: What is the relationship between language, ethnicity, and identity in the reggaetón community? How does language use within the reggaetón community confirm or challenge our knowledge of the Spanish Language and race? How have other global languages and cultures been impacted by reggaetón culture?

A considerable amount of instructional time will focus on acoustic phonetics, hypothesis testing, and spectrographic analysis. Students will apply their knowledge of course content through homework assignments, short research projects, oral and written quizzes, and exams. The goal of this course is to provide students with a sound foundation of the Spanish sound system and also with a level of analytical knowledge that enables them to succeed in research-oriented linguistics courses.

Cinema From Spain,"This class is a study of some of the best contemporary Spanish Women Film Directors. Since the nineteenth century, with the advent of post-Enlightenment thought and the slow but steady integration of women into the social sphere and cultural arena Spain, has had a strong tradition in feminist thought, in women writers, and in feminist social movements. Moreover, women have been fundamental protagonists in some of the most important social struggles and cultural movements of the twentieth century in the Hispanic world. After the death of the dictator Francisco Franco, and the emergence of democracy, women started to play an important role in all areas of culture and art.  This class will examine, from a feminist point of view, the films of women whose works (and experiences) center on social and personal events and problems such as historical events, domestic violence, maternity, childhood, the construction of gender and sexuality, memory, trauma, desire, love, etc. Through filmic, historical, cultural, and theoretical readings on the collective and the intimate, the class will visualize and analyze a number of interesting Spanish films that bring to the center the gaze of women on the collective and the personal, on the social and the intimate.","Moreiras-Menor,Cristina",SPANISH,421,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Spanish Women Filmmakers,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Advanced Studies in Hispanic Culture and Society,"Across Latin America in the last decades, there has been a surge of works of historical fiction — primarily novels, but also plays films, and telenovelas — that take slavery, racial discrimination, and violence, wars of conquest against indigenous peoples, or inter-racial romances as their subject.  Though fictional, these works explicitly engage with contemporary historical debates, often seeking to center marginal historical characters and viewpoints in order to create alternative national histories that promote greater racial inclusion, awareness, or equality.  We will focus on two case studies: Argentina and Brazil. 
 While in Argentina (long regarded as a mainly white and culturally European country), several historians and novelists have sought to rewrite national history to reflect processes of racial mixture and the presence of non-white people, in Brazil, historians and novelists have worked to debunk longstanding visions of society as racially mixed and harmonious, focusing on topics like racism, slavery, activism, and memory.  We will examine fictional works alongside historical documents and the writings of historians themselves to try to understand how history and fiction reflect and shape ideas about race in each country, and how these cases compare or differ from one another.
This course counts toward the literature requirement for the Spanish minor.Class Format:The course will be taught in English, with readings in English as well as in Spanish and Portuguese (students must be able to read and speak at course level for at least one of these Romance languages; reading knowledge of the other is encouraged, but not required).","Alberto,Paulina Laura",SPANISH,430,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Comparative Topics in Spanish and Portuguese: Stories and Histories of Race in Brazil and Argentina,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Advanced Studies in Hispanic Culture and Society,"La cultura popular a lo largo del siglo XX encadenó situaciones en las que su proyecto fue no solo un síntoma de cambios sociales y políticos de gran calado sino su detonante. La cultura dominante, a través de aquello que hemos venido en llamar industria del espectáculo, capitalizó una buena parte de esta energía compartida; pero otra quedó en sus márgenes alimentando mitos y leyendas contemporáneas. El empoderamiento personal y colectivo, la voluntad de cambio, la liberación sexual, la negación, la anarquía,… todo convivió en un mundo nocturno, canalla y desinhibido, que ha construido en gran parte la sociedad en la que vivimos.","Barenblit, Ferran  ",SPANISH,430,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Cuerpos, revoluciones y rock?n?roll",3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

"Gender, Sexuality, and Culture","In the wake of contemporary feminist movements across the hemisphere, this course provides a historical perspective to feminist politics and thinking in Latin America. Our discussions will follow two axes: first, we will explore the junctures at which feminism intersects with other struggles for change and constitutes a rich site for the critique of colonialism and social relations under capitalism; the second, by honing onto feminism’s creative potency to imagine and experiment with alternative arrangements for life.  To do so we will analyze an array of texts both literary and philosophical as well as other forms of cultural expression like photography, painting, and film.","Sabau Fernandez,Ana",SPANISH,432,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Feminisms in the Hispanic World,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Political and Economic Thought in Latin America/Spain,"Far from some natural order, capitalism has a history, and we can study that history to see when and how it emerged. While Britain’s Industrial Revolution is probably the most familiar reference point, some of the most important economic thinkers, including Adam Smith and Karl Marx, point to the so-called “discovery” (i.e. the conquest and colonization) of the Americas as a key moment in this process. Taking these arguments as its point of departure, this course explores the colonial roots of modern capitalism by examining the writings of Spanish and Portuguese jurists, theologians, and missionaries about the colonial project from the late fifteenth to the mid-seventeenth centuries. What new problems and dilemmas did Iberian colonialism raise, and how did early modern writers attempt to rationalize and resolve them? What new political and economic ideas emerged as a result? To what extent did these writers seek to reconcile political domination and economic extraction with their stated spiritual and religious objectives? More broadly, how should we understand the relationship between colonialism and capitalism, and what does that analysis mean for our understanding of the world today? Readings will consist for the most part of primary sources from the colonial period, but will also include more recent work by political economists, critics, and historians.","Nemser,Daniel J",SPANISH,438,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Conquest and Capitalism,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Political and Economic Thought in Latin America/Spain,"This course will study the symbiosis of politics, economy, and ideology in the making of modern Latin America. Taught in Spanish, the course will be divided into three parts: Part 1 will discuss how liberalism connected with the organization of modern Latin America. Part 2 will have students exposed to two ideological discourses which followed after the decline of liberalism: populism, and neoliberalism. Part 3 will discuss three important discourses that counteracted capitalism: dependency theory, socialism, and the theology of liberation.","Sanjines,Javier C",SPANISH,438,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Economy, Politics, and Ideology in Latin America",3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Romance Studies: Introduction to French-Spanish Literary Relations,"This course seeks to familiarize students with the complex and multifaceted tradition of Marxist theory and practice while also tracing Marxism’s role in some of today’s most vibrant political movements. Our comparative approach will consider classical texts like The Communist Manifesto and State and Revolution alongside lesser-known but no less important works by Latin American and Caribbean writers and intellectuals. Instead of working toward a single definition of Marxism, we will explore the history of heterodox experimentation with the tradition’s most basic categories, always mindful of the continuities and discontinuities between different “Marxisms.” This necessarily interdisciplinary course will incorporate readings and discussions that span philosophy, literature, history, and politics. Special focus will be directed at Marxist analyses that attend to (and also sometimes fail to attend to) the interpenetration of class, race, and gender. Key figures for the course include: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, V. I. Lenin, Clara Zetkin, Mao Tse-Tung, Louis Althusser, Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, José Carlos Mariátegui, José María Arguedas, Álvaro García Linera, Raquel Guttiérez, Subcomandante Marcos, and Silvia Federici.","Arnall,Gavin",SPANISH,445,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Comparative Marxism,3,,,A reading knowledge of French and Spanish.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Colonial Latin America,"When we say that race is a “social construction,” we mean not only that the concept has no basis in biological reality but also that it has a history—a history we can study in order to shed light on the past as well as the present and future. This course traces the history of race, racism, and racialization back to the conquest and colonization of the Americas during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. One consequence of Spanish and Portuguese colonialism was the formation of new racial categories (like “Indian,” “Black,” and even “Jew”) that materialized through specific practices of domination. The course will consider questions such as: What are race and racism and what kinds of ideological “work” do they do? What is the relationship between colonialism and racism? How have race and racism changed from the colonial past to the present day? Why have they endured so successfully over time? Readings include primary sources written during the colonial period as well as recent critical and theoretical work on race, racism, and racialization.","Nemser,Daniel J",SPANISH,470,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Racism and Colonialism in Latin America,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Indigenous Societies,"This course will focus on indigenous societies in the Americas and how we perceive them today. One of its purposes is to give students an idea of how much we know about some of them but, most of all, how much we ignore. It will also explore the difficult relationship between Western academic disciplines such as Anthropology (physical, cultural, and social), Archaeology, and Historiography, and indigenous peoples of the world. The readings and class discussions will try to explore the ways in which indigeneity was created from said disciplines. In order to do so, we will focus on some recent classic texts that had an enormous impact on the ways in which the non-specialists (that is, the general public) view indigenous peoples today.","Verdesio,Gustavo",SPANISH,472,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Colonial/Postcolonial Studies in Latin-American Cultures,"This is a class dealing with Latin American wars, from racial conflicts to civil wars, conventional or sovereign wars to low-intensity conflicts, dirty wars and wars on terrorism, narcotraffic, and so on. The main hypothesis is that the question of war should always be articulated to the historical transformation of the accumulations processes and the metamorphoses of sovereignty (power relations). We will focus mainly on racial conflicts of the 18th century, the Independence wars of the early 19th century, the pacification processes of mid-late 19th century, the Mexican Revolution, the Cuban revolution, the Latin American guerillas, the cold war, and the Containment, up to the current wars against terrorism and narcotraffic. The class is, in other words, an interrogation of the securitarian paradigm informing Latin American history, its pollical economy of violence, and the relations between law and stasis.","Villalobos Ruminott,Sergio R",SPANISH,473,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Latin American Wars,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Case Studies in Peninsular Spanish and Latin American Literature,"In this course, we will critically explore the history of US-Mexico relations. Starting in the early 19th century and moving into the present, we will engage different forms of written and visual culture- including travel journals, legislature, journalistic pieces, novels, maps, and film- to explore how cultural interventions have mediated, shaped, and represented the uneven political and economic interactions between both countries. The course will pay particular attention to how the question of race has played out in this complicated history. While at moments, both countries’ governments have joined efforts and collaborated in shaping racialized geographies that stretch across their borders, at others, frictions and tensions have marked the tone of the interactions between them. This course will trace both the changing and persistent tropes circling around US-Mexico political and economic relations, opening a space to critically reflect on the present. Some of the topics we will discuss in class include the history and formation of the border; economic interests and projects like NAFTA; the so-called war on drugs.","Sabau Fernandez,Ana",SPANISH,485,"Fall 2021, ",Section 003, - US-Mexico Relations through Culture,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Topics in Hispanic Literature/History/Culture,"Where does Antisemitism come from? How has it survived into the modern-day? To find an answer, we have to look back in time, long before the conflicts of the Holocaust, to the origins of European Christianity.  Throughout the Middle Ages, Christianity compared itself in to Judaism, and this rivalry was nowhere more active than in the Iberian Peninsula, the land in Europe with the largest Jewish population. This course explores the history of Jewish-Christian debate and conflict in the pre-modern period. It considers the formation of the “hermeneutical Jew,” an image formed in Christian writing that depicted Jews as “bad” readers of the Bible. It will then turn to medieval engagements with these traditional images, looking at the rise of the Christian friars (“monks with a social life”) in the thirteenth century and the role of public debate in the later Middle Ages. We will read Nachmanides’s representation of the Disputation of Barcelona (1263), including the modern graphic novel based on his account. We will look at philosophical attacks by Jews and Christians on each other’s texts (Joseph Kimhi, Petrus Alfonsi, Abner of Burgos), and conclude with a discussion of the “converso” problem of fifteenth-century Iberia, in which debates raged over the place of Jewish converts in Christian society (culminating in the foundation of the Spanish Inquisition and the expulsion of Jews in 1492). This course will constitute a historical exploration of the important role of Judaism in Christian thought and the common arguments, both philosophical and literary, used by Jews throughout the Middle Ages to counter Christian attacks and resist Christian appeals to conversion and assimilation.","Szpiech, Ryan  ",SPANISH,488,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002, - The Jewish-Christian Debate in Medieval Iberia and Beyond,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Base of the Pyramid:  Business Innovation and Social Impact,"Business can, and indeed must, play a greater role in responding to society's grand challenges. The deep poverty faced by the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) - the 4-5 billion poorest people on this planet and constituting approximately two-thirds of humanity - presents a challenge on the grandest scale. While donation-based approaches have their place, the promise of achieving both profits and social impact through market-based approaches offers an exciting alternative. Business opportunities in health care, energy, agriculture, sanitation, housing, education, consumer goods, clean water and other impact areas can lead to a more inclusive capitalism. The challenge is to build enterprises that are sustainable at scale in an impoverished and unfamiliar market context. The course integrates concepts of strategy, international business, entrepreneurship, non-profit management, and development to stimulate the leadership skills and competitive imagination needed to design, pilot, and scale BoP enterprises. Emphasizing action-based learning and using carefully selected cases, readings, videos, and outside guests, class sessions focus on: 1)identifying the opportunities and challenges associated with serving BoP markets; and 2) developing a toolkit of strategies, frameworks, and processes for building sustainable, scalable enterprises that create economic and social value.","London, Ted  ",STRATEGY,445,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,Sustain,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

While donation-based approaches have their place, the promise of achieving both profits and social impact through market-based approaches offers an exciting alternative. Business opportunities in health care, energy, agriculture, sanitation, housing, education, consumer goods, clean water and other impact areas can lead to a more inclusive capitalism. The challenge is to build enterprises that are sustainable at scale in an impoverished and unfamiliar market context. The course integrates concepts of strategy, international business, entrepreneurship, non-profit management, and development to stimulate the leadership skills and competitive imagination needed to design, pilot, and scale BoP enterprises. Emphasizing action-based learning and using carefully selected cases, readings, videos, and outside guests, class sessions focus on: 1)identifying the opportunities and challenges associated with serving BoP markets; and 2) developing a toolkit of strategies, frameworks, and processes for building sustainable, scalable enterprises that create economic and social value.","London, Ted  ",STRATEGY,445,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002,,3,,Sustain,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Environmental Justice Grassroots Community Organizing in Detroit for Changing Times,"This course looks at movements, resistance, resilience, and liberation. Community Organizing is growing as an academic field, especially as it relates to urban studies. A growing body of evidence reveals that people of color and low-income persons have borne greater environmental and health risks than society at large in their neighborhood, workplace, and playgrounds. Over the last decade,
grassroots activists have attempted to change the way governments implement environmental and health laws. Grassroots groups have organized, educated, and empowered themselves to improve the way government regulations and environmental policies are administered.","Seales, Diana WasaAnung'gokwe",SW,312,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Introduction to the Theory of Music,"Theory 137 is a course that provides a broad introduction to the basics of music theory, designed for students who are not music majors. Given the introductory nature of the course, we will begin with a thorough review of the fundamental concepts of music, including notation, pitch, rhythm, meter, scales, and chords. Later in the semester we will use our knowledge of these fundamentals to understand more complicated music-theoretic topics, such as how chords are joined together to create musical phrases, and how these phrases can be elaborated. Finally, we will learn a little bit about how to combine melodies together in more complicated musical pieces, which is also known as the art of counterpoint, and which is the basis for some of the greatest musical masterworks in the classical tradition—and we will also learn some of the basics of how to set words to music. All of this will be supplemented with exercises in which we will listen and respond to a variety of pieces, hunt for music relevant to the topic at hand, and do a lot of singing, writing and harmonizing tunes. The final goal of the course will be to write a song of your own, complete with words and instrumental accompaniment. This highlights the essentially simple goal of the course: since most of us like music in some form or the other, this course is meant to just help us enjoy and appreciate this music better, and a little bit more systematically, by providing a broad introduction to the basics of music theory—and to give us a chance to experience the joys of actually writing such music ourselves, as songwriters.","Hannaford        he-him, Marc  ",THEORY,137,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,No previous formal training in music theory only basic understanding of musical notation.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Topics in Drama,"How has the canon of western European drama changed in the hands of theatrical practitioners in an age of revision and reinterpretation?

This course is designed to introduce students to the major works of Brecht, Beckett, Strindberg, Pirandello, Wilde, and Shaw in addition to Ibsen and Chekhov, but as it does so it considers such issues as the canon’s resistance to change, the representation of the female figure on stage, the privileged position of male voices, the championing of progressive social and political issues, the transition to film and other video resources, and the creative role today’s world theater plays in establishing a new theatrical idiom for the contemporary stage.","Brater,Enoch",THTREMUS,399,"Fall 2021, ",Section 011, - Modern European Drama from Ibsen to Beckett,3,HU,,,,May be repeated for credit.,

How can we build effective Information Systems to accomplish important goals such as facilitating commerce, fostering civic participation, and supporting human relationships? This course will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to begin to address the key issues associated with Information and its impact on human lives. Issues will range from the theoretical (what is Information, and how do humans construct it?), to the cultural (is life on the screen a qualitatively different phenomenon from experiences with earlier distance-shrinking and knowledge-building technologies such as telephones?), to the practical (what are the basic architectures of computing and networks?). Successful completion of this ""gateway"" course will give you the conceptual tools necessary to understand the politics, economics, and culture of the Information Age, providing a foundation for later study in Information or a valuable complement to studies in other disciplines.","Lampe, Cliff  ",UC,110,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

Foundations of Sustainable Food Systems,"Some scholars argue that we have entered a new geological epoch—the “Anthropocene”—characterized by unprecedented human alteration of global processes. This fast-paced global change both affects and is affected by agriculture. Concurrent food, energy, water, and climate crises, and a global rise in obesity amidst widespread hunger and undernutrition, have re-focused public attention on the deficiencies and complexities of the global food system. The dominant industrial food system has increasingly well-documented social, ecological, and health-related costs. Yet, a diversity of ‘alternative’ food systems demonstrates that agriculture can be resource-conserving, equitable, and health-promoting. Increasing food system sustainability requires interdisciplinarity along multiple dimensions: reconnecting agriculture with ecological systems, reshaping food production systems to be more nutrition-sensitive, and ensuring that policies and institutions that impact the food system safeguard social equity and the environment. Linking theory and practice is also essential, involving the diverse range of actors moving food from farm to fork. It is, therefore, not surprising that demand is growing for interdisciplinary scholars who are equipped to analyze and address the complex challenges of sustainable food production and global food and nutrition security. This course will offer a unique opportunity for students to gain interdisciplinary knowledge of food systems and to integrate theory and practice through experiential learning and dialogue-based inquiry both on campus and in the community. Interdisciplinary research and education require bridging worldviews and recognizing the values implicit in different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. This course will incorporate multiple perspectives, from the local to the global level, and an understanding of how those perspectives are underpinned by different epistemologies and value systems. That is, this course aims to directly engage with values, exploring how they shape food systems. Benefitting from collaborative interdisciplinary instruction that draws on the expertise of three professors from three different departments at the University of Michigan, students will develop competencies and cognitive skills in the area of food system sustainability including critical and systems thinking, creativity, and analytical ability.","Hoey,Lesli",URP,427,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.

Gender and Popular Culture,"Gender and popular culture are interrelated social constructs that have a profound impact on our everyday lives.  Movies, TV, magazines, and the internet not only reflect what it means to be a man or woman today, they also inform those identities.  This course will focus on the visual aspects of these phenomena and survey key methods for interpreting them, including the gaze, queer theory, radical feminist theory, Foucauldean theory, and issues of socioeconomic status. We will apply these theories to examples of contemporary American culture from Instagram and Bar Stool Sports to the suburban home and Beyonce.  This process will also allow us to debate questions like: Does gender have to be binary?  How does gender affect the experience of space?  Is the availability of pornography affecting our ideas of gender?  Why is child rearing such a contested domain?  How does racial identity influence gender norms?  And perhaps most importantly, who is missing from popular representations of gender?","Crasnow,Sascha M",WGS,211,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Global Perspectives on the HIV and AIDS Epidemic,"Beginning in 1981 when the first case of HIV was diagnosed, the HIV and AIDs epidemic has dramatically altered the social, cultural, economic, political and demographic landscape worldwide. Understanding the drivers and the implications of this epidemic of individuals, families, communities and countries requires insight into the myriad of biological, socio-cultural and political factors that shape individual knowledge and behavior, access to preventive and treatment modalities, as well as the political and international responses to the epidemic. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the social and behavioral factors that influence the transmission and prevention of HIV and AIDs worldwide. Topics to be covered include the natural history and epidemiology of the AIDS virus, the mechanisms of transmission, high risk and vulnerable populations, social determinants of risk and vulnerability, theoretical foundations for HIV prevention programs, primary and secondary HIV prevention strategies, treatment of HIV and AIDS, and implications of HIV and AIDS for individuals, families, communities and countries.
By the conclusion of this course, students will:
Have a general understanding of HIV and AIDS- how it’s transmitted and develops into AIDS.
Understand the history, context, biology and epidemiology of the HIV and AIDS epidemic worldwide.
Understand the biological, behavioral, psychosocial, economic, cultural and political factors that shape people’s risk for HIV, and underlying the underlying causes of these factors.
Understand the specific behavioral, biomedical and structural intervention approaches designed to reduce HIV and its consequences.
Understand the social, economic, cultural, political and demographic consequences of the HIV and AIDS epidemic globally.Intended Audience:First and second year students interested in the topic.Class Format:This class utilizes mixed method approaches that include course readings, lectures, in-class and online discussions, group presentations, and guest presentations from public health practitioners and experts in the field of HIV and AIDS.

Topics in Gender and the Humanities,"In this class, we’ll examine women rhetors who challenged and complicated rhetorical conventions in order to make their voices heard. In addition to organized social movements such as abolition, suffrage, labor, and equal rights, we’ll also consider less-formal channels through which women have engaged the public sphere, such as music, journalism, and digital activism. Throughout we will pay close attention to how women have used language to effect social change. We will also pay close attention to issues that have both united and divided women, especially along lines of race, class, and culture.","Gold, David  ",WGS,213,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Women in Literature: Women, Rhetoric, Activism",3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Contested Spaces: Art, Architecture, Politics","This course encourages students to think critically about how specific sites and objects have participated in the construction of class, race, gender, body ability, and other socially constructed markers of difference. Building on the histories of art and architecture, the course proposes the category of ""space"" as an alternative to the geographic, aesthetic, and analytic categories that have shaped the canons of these two disciplines. We address the architecture of those excluded from these canons by examining how objects and sites structure social relations and broader networks of power.","Leon, Ana Maria  ",WGS,215,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Thinking Class: Inequality in Media, Bodies, Environment, and More","According to ideals of American exceptionalism, we live in a classless society.

What does a class look like in America, and beyond? How, where, and by whom is it created & perpetuated, and how does is it play out? Through readings, media, & discussion, this seminar examines class on the ground, in various sites & contexts: media & popular culture; preschool, high school, & university education; the workplace; food, bodies, & health; politics; friendship & sexuality; family & childrearing; rural & urban spaces; the environment. Throughout our discussions & written work we will consider the roles of gender, race, ethnicity, & history.

Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies,"A survey introduction to the critical, theoretical, and historical study of women and gender from feminist and cross-cultural perspectives. Readings range across a wide body of feminist scholarship in order to familiarize students with key questions, theoretical tools, and issues within the field. The course aims to sharpen critical awareness of how gender operates in institutional and cultural contexts, in students’ own lives, and the lives of others. Two questions are central to the course:

How is gender created and maintained through social practices (e.g., ideology, media representations, social norms)?

How do gendered social practices intersect with other social categories, such as race, ethnicity, class, disability, and sexuality?

Because Women’s and Gender Studies grew out of activism, this course will explore the relationship between how we generate critical knowledge about gender and how we work to use this knowledge to promote social justice at gender's intersection with other identities. The course materials are drawn from the US but also other cultural contexts.Course Requirements:Course requirements include short writing assignments, active participation in the discussion section, and a final project that asks students to build on their own interests.","Alexy,Allison",WGS,240,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,

What can we learn about race and gender using the lens of popular culture? In this course, we will examine how Black women construct and are constructed by popular culture in the U.S. by building a set of critical tools that can help us navigate this rich terrain. We will explore topics such as representations of Black femininity, Black sexuality and representation, stereotypes, and subversive media, over a wide range of popular culture artifacts. And we will consider the impact and meaning of Black women such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Janelle Monaé, Michelle Obama, and Janet Mock.","Kelow-Bennett, Lydia  ",WGS,258,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Black Women in Popular Culture,3,ID,,,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,
Women in the Ancient Mediterranean,"


Women make up half the population, and yet we have little evidence of their experiences in their own words for most of human history. This course engages creatively and deeply with the limits of historical knowledge by exploring the lives of women in antiquity. Focusing on the multicultural world of the Roman empire, we will examine the roles of women in the political, domestic, and religious spheres, as well as how women were implicated in major cultural transformations, such as the rise of Christianity. Through sources that include literary texts, medical treatises, material culture, and works of art, students will learn to read against the grain in order to explore the opportunities and obstacles that women faced long ago – and, in certain ways, still, face today.","Freidin,Anna Bonnell",WGS,303,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Gender and Immigration:  Identity, Race, and Place"," Refugees, migrants, immigrants, diaspora groups, and transnational actors are all terms that describe people who undertake different acts of mobility or travel across borders to seek refuge. But how are these terms different? This course focuses on these various acts of mobility to show how they are labeled differently under different political and social circumstances. We examine the gendered cultural and political meanings people and governments give to mobility, border-crossing, and displacement in this turbulent time in the era of globalization and transnationalism.

 

In this course we will also emphasize the experiences of both old and new generations of immigrants in order to understand the historical context of migration, globalization, and the processes involved in the imagination of place and nation building. One important lesson that students learn in this class is that the political processes that define the often-conflated meanings attached to the refugee, immigrant, and diaspora population cannot be divorced from histories of nationalism and transnationalism and their deeply rooted constructions in gender, race, ethnic, and class relations. Race, ethnicity, and sexism are significant components, and the course addresses them through cross-cultural ethnographies, media reports, documentary films, art, and other texts to explain how citizens and non-citizens are marked differently based on both legal and cultural terminologies.

 

Students also learn that systems of racialization and discrimination don’t just happen at the moment of border-crossing or when refugees, migrants, and diaspora populations settle in new homelands; these modes of exclusion are also experienced in various forms in their countries of origin. Some of the forces that lead to situations of refugee-ness, migration, and dispersal include religious, ethnic, gender, racial, and political discrimination encountered at home.  The course examines the different forms of these discriminations and how refugee, immigrant, and diaspora communities encounter them, live them, negotiate them, and resist them through their own cultural practices and other strategies of activism.

 

We will particularly explore how questions of power, race, and class intersect to shape refugees and immigrants’ daily struggles for justice and human rights. How do refugees and immigrants attempt to create and “imagine” their own social world with reference to their new locations and their homelands? Our readings and discussion will focus on cultural and theoretical perspectives from the social sciences, specifically anthropology, history, and literature.  And we will take as examples the ethnographies and narratives of immigrants from different parts of the world, specifically Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome.","Fadlalla,Amal Hassan",WGS,304,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001," - Refugees of Unjust Worlds: Globalization, Gender and Nation",3,SS,,The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Critical Theory in Medicine and Healing,"This writing intensive lecture course introduces upper division undergraduates to the critical anthropological analysis of illness, health, healing and medicine.  Our investigation will be comparative, examining how different systems of meaning and power make sense of bodily states, historically and cross-culturally.  We will explore current and past medical anthropological approaches — political economic, symbolic, feminist, post-structuralist — in order to critically evaluate how well these frameworks convey the lived experience of bodies in their local worlds.  The intellectual excitement of medical anthropology comes from its ability to challenge categories and boundaries that seem natural and fixed.  Ultimately, my goal is for students to think differently about the embodied relations of health and affliction as produced through the natural ""order of things"".","Roberts,Elizabeth FS",WGS,307,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, SS",,One course in ANTHRCUL or RCSSCI or WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240) or WGS (WOMENSTD) with an SS designation.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Special Topics in Gender and the Humanities,"Using a transnational, interdisciplinary, and intersectional feminist lens, this course will examine literary articulations of the complex relationship between gender and health. Defining health to include physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, sexual and/or reproductive well-being, we will read key literary works across genres - novels, short stories, essays, poetry, memoir – alongside scholarly articles to shed light on the gendered terrain of health in diverse contexts. We will also attempt to relate the textual material to society, polity, and lived experience. Course themes include, among others, the impact of gender role expectations on emotional and mental health; economic inequalities; immigrant well-being; racial and sexual violence; transgender issues; eating disorders, nutrition; and holistic approaches to health.

Special Topics in Gender and the Humanities,"This course will look at contemporary uses of theatre and performance in medical and health contexts. We will investigate the use of performance among NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) and medical education providers, and how performance artists use art to interrogate categories of health, gender and sexuality. We will find out about new ways of conceiving arts’ power to intervene or change (post/colonial) gender, sexuality, and health paradigms. How can applied theatre add new perspectives to ongoing debates about the cultural locations of health care, theatre, and power? How can theatre address domestic violence (we’ll engage a community performance created in the Solomon Islands), center indigenous perspectives on two-spirit well-being and suicide prevention (using Turtle Island examples), offer intersectional analyses of disability’s effects on marriageability and self-determination (we’ll look at a disability-led video/theatre performance from Burkina Faso), or engage discussions of sexual health management in the U.S. and elsewhere?","Kuppers,Petra",WGS,313,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Health, Gender, and Performance",3,HU,,,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,With permission of instructor.
Gender and Sexuality Studies in Literature,"What meanings do the terms “queer” and “of color” carry? How do different literary and artistic genres represent the experiences of (racial, sexual, gender, or other social) minorities? What relationships can we trace between textual legibility (how a work of art can, or asks to, be interpreted) and cultural legibility (how an individual or community can, or asks to, be identified)? In this course, we will explore these questions as we read, watch, and evaluate artistic works that transport us across the globe—from Parisian bars to the Rio Grande Valley to Philippine jungles to Oklahoman indigenous communities.","Valella,Daniel",WGS,314,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Queer of Color Literature and Culture,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

We will also study women as writers; among our course texts will be the first two books known to be written in English by women. Several of our readings will be religious, including some truly surprising miracles of the Virgin Mary, and stories of tenacious and daring female martyrs. But we will study a number of secular texts, too, including a poem about a woman who brews beer and stories featuring witches.

Black Feminist Approaches to Health,"This course examines black women’s health, longevity, and well-being from a black feminist perspective.  We will employ an intersectional approach that takes gender, race, sexuality, and class into consideration.  The course will focus on how the interlocking systems of racism, poverty, violence, and sexism influence the embodied health experiences of black women. Students will explore several themes including enslaved women and the birth of modern gynecology, sexual health, community-based health activism, weight and fat stigma, and caregiving/self-care. Essentially, the course will consider if and how black feminism can impact black women’s health outcomes.","Purkiss, Ava  ",WGS,322,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,"WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240) Intro to Women's Studies or WGS/NURS 220 (WOMENSTD/NURS 220) Perspectives in Women's Health or WGS 250 (WOMENSTD 250) Race, Gender and Nation.",,May not be repeated for credit.,
Black Feminist Thought and Practice,"What is Black Feminism? In this course, we will explore the history of Black women’s gendered and racial politics in the United States and, in particular, how their beliefs and experiences have differed from other groups. How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism. Course readings are drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods with the goal of exposing students to the history of Black Feminist thought and the breadth of Black Feminist scholarship, activism, and methodologies. By the end of the semester, students will be conversant in the major concepts of Black Feminism and Black Women’s Studies and have developed the analytical tools to understand how race, gender, and class interact to produce the unique experiences of Black women in the United States.","Strongman,Saraellen",WGS,323,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Black Feminism(s),3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Feminist Thought,"This course explores major intellectual debates and dialogues in the field of feminist thought. How has feminist theory – as an expansive body of scholarship that situates women’s and other marginalized voices at the core of analysis – evolved as a response to “androcentric” ways of knowing? Interrogating the gendered trajectories of knowledge production, and how women have figured as silenced subjects of texts, genres, and paternalistic state policies, we will examine the contributions of multiple feminisms – liberal, materialist, poststructuralist, postcolonial, Black and woman-of-color feminisms, and feminisms of faith, for instance, and their interstices – and how they unsettle gendered binaries and essentialist understandings. Using a transnational lens to trace the ways in which gender intersects with race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and other registers of identity to produce complex structures of power and privilege in different locations and under differing historical conditions, we will examine their relevance to individual and collective experience. Eschewing an uneasy relationship between feminism in theory and practice, we will probe, instead, into how the nuances of feminist thought might be applied to research, literature, art, education, and policy. The course is interdisciplinary. It will deploy literary, historical, political, philosophical, sociological, and economic perspectives, and weave together a variety of theoretical, analytical, and creative texts.","Dhar,Debotri",WGS,330,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Feminist Thought,"What is feminist theory? By what methods do feminists create knowledge? How have working-class women, women of color, women in the global south, and sexual minorities reshaped the meaning(s) of feminist action and thought? And what are the connections between feminist theory and feminist activism? This course will introduce you to feminist thought through a variety of historical and contemporary readings concerning different forms of feminism that have emerged over time, and their proponents and critics, for example: liberal, radical, Marxist, psychoanalytic, poststructural, queer, and transnational. Throughout the course we will explore how knowledge, power, and gender are interwoven in particular ways and how various feminist approaches seek to disrupt and reshape these taken-for-granted systems of inequality.

"Special Topics in Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the U.S.","This seminar investigates the rise of stereotypes, shared identities, and norms as they took shape in the first three centuries of European colonization of North America. How did the division of labor in the colonies produce ideas about race, gender, and sexuality? How did people understand their attractions and gender identities? When and why did categories like “black,” “red,” and “white” come to be universally understood? Readings will include Aphra Behn’s Oroonoko, Richard Ligon’s A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados, William Earle Jr.’s Obi, or the History of Three-Fingered Jack, private diaries, letters, and Native- and African-American memoirs.

"Special Topics in Gender, Culture, and Representation","What does it mean to love? As both a literary genre and a system of emotion, romance has played a crucial role in answering this question across the Middle East, from the novels of late antiquity (Greek and Latin) to medieval Islamic and Christian tales of love (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, French, and Georgian), including the great books of Layli & Majnun, the 1001 Nights, and the Haft Paykar. This class offers an introduction to the romantic tradition through a close reading of some of its prominent examples, with an eye for how they construct and subvert their own ideology: even as they vaunt chastity and fidelity, normative gender roles, and licit sex (typically heterosexual marriage) as ideal virtues, they simultaneously interrogate those ideals with numerous cases of betrayal, murder, castration, gender-bending, and illicit sex (incest, adultery). The role of women in society, and their agency in shaping their stories and destinies, lies at the center of this negotiation and will be a constant focal point for us throughout the course. Although we will connect these texts with modern examples, the bulk of our readings are drawn from the pre-modern period, which will afford us a better understanding of where romantic love comes from, and a diachronic view into points of difference and similarity with its modern incarnations. In this seminar class, students will develop a framework for critically unpacking contemporary notions of love, allowing them to reconsider how such seemingly universal experiences can be conditioned by society and culture, yet also to recognize the drives, emotions, and obsessions that we may know from our personal lives in people who lived and loved centuries ago and continents away.
For each session, active participation in class discussion, with students taking turns in leadership roles, will be expected. One blog post of about 500 words will be assigned every week, and every 2--3 weeks, a written assignment of 1250-1500 words will be due. A short reflection paper will be turned in at the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to develop your skills in critical reading, writing, thinking, and analysis.","Cross,Cameron",WGS,344,"Fall 2021, ",Section 002," - Sin, Sex, and Desire: Romance in the Middle East",3,HU,,WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240).,,May be elected twice for credit.

Special Topics in Gender in a Global Context,"This course examines, through a comparative, transnational, and intersectional feminist lens, the complex relationship(s) between sexual violence and the state under differing historical contexts and in diverse geographical locations. We will interrogate the colonial and the postcolonial, “first” and “third” worlds, text, and context. Tracing how gender intersects with race, religion, nation, social class, and sexuality, we will frame sexual violence as simultaneously personal and political as we critically examine the political, cultural, legal, regulatory, and discursive roles of the state. Some of the material focuses on South Asia; however, the scope of the course is historically and geographically broad. The course is interdisciplinary; we will draw from historical, literary, visual, political, sociological, and other perspectives and the productive interstices between them. We will weave together theoretical, analytical, and creative (e.g. fiction, film, art) texts. There will also be in-class case studies that we will collectively examine.","Dhar,Debotri",WGS,345,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Sexual Violence and the State,3,,,WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240).,,May be elected twice for credit.

Sociology of Sexualities,"Human sexuality is often thought of as a realm of experience outside of or ""unmarked"" by society. In contrast, this course introduces students to the myriad ways that sexual desire and sexual activity are structured by social relations, and to how sexuality, sexual practices, and sexual identities vary in time and space. Social scientific theories of sexuality are considered, and historical accounts of sexual practices are reviewed. Other topics include the emergence and elaboration of forms of sexual desire (“sexualities” or categories of sexual orientation/preference), sexual subcultures and communities; relationships between sexual identity and sexual behavior; sexual hierarchies; sexual ethics; the political manipulation of sexuality; the institutional nature of heterosexuality; and how sexuality as a social institution intersects with hierarchies of race, class, and gender.","McGann, PJ  ",WGS,348,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,One introductory course in Sociology.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Nonprofit Management, Community Engagement, and Feminist Practice","This course aims to address the gaps and misconceptions that often exist between feminism as an academic discourse and feminism in practice. Through classroom engagement and community involvement, students will explore the intersection of academia and activism as it pertains to working to improve the lives of women and their communities. Students will learn nonprofit management basics, think critically about community engagement, and explore the applicability of feminist practice to each.  WGS 350 students commit to volunteering in an area community based organization, as well as to active participation in the classroom. Students will have the opportunity to dialogue with nonprofit organization founders and leaders from diverse backgrounds and learn about nonprofit management and community engagement from a variety of perspectives. Through readings, written assignments, classroom participation, and service experiences, this course endeavors to nurture and facilitate: critical thinking about community service, non-profit organizations, feminisms, and their relationships to social change; consideration of how feminist thought can be applied to work in communities and how communities can inform feminist thought; and the development of skills for working effectively within community based organizations and with communities around issues that affect women’s lives.","Welch,Leseliey Rose",WGS,350,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,4,,"CBL, Experiential",WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240) or WGS/NURS 220 (WOMENSTD/NURS 220).,,May not be repeated for credit.,
"Gender, Sexuality, and Power in Premodern China","This course explores gender and sexuality in China before the 20th century. Are “women” and “men” useful categories of analysis for premodern China, or did people think of themselves in other terms? What role did bodies, duties, virtues, and desires play in relationships among people? What role did writing play in negotiations of gender roles and expressions of sexual desire in premodern China? In this course, you will learn how gender and sexuality functioned in a range of premodern discourses and practices. We will begin by reading foundational Buddhist, Daoist, Confucian texts that prescribe gendered roles and virtues. We will bring these into conversation with the conception of the body and sex difference presented in traditional medical texts, which drew on all of these traditions. In the second part of the course, we will investigate the relationship between writing and gender, asking how people described gender and sexuality in letters, poetry, plays, novels, and short stories. We engage these experimental, utopian, or prescriptive gendered textual spaces with an interest to understand how people conceived of the delights and dangers, possibilities, and constraints of the negotiations between their bodies and texts. We will occasionally take our investigation beyond the textual realm to consider other sorts of objects: paintings, decorative objects, book illustrations, and theatrical performances. We will conclude by evaluating attacks on the traditional sex-gender system by feminist modernizing movements at the turn of the 20th century.","Rebull,Anne Elizabeth",WGS,352,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,At least one course in Asian studies or Women's studies.,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Race and Identity in Music,"This course explores the parameters of racial and ethnic identities in music. From the discourse surrounding exoticism and Orientalism, to the effects of evocative instrumentation, the use of dialect, and foreign subjects, the focus of this class is to understand how racial and ethnic difference can be portrayed musically. Musical case studies will be drawn from the nineteenth century through the present with a strong emphasis on the genre of opera.  Central questions to be raised are: how is racial/ethnic difference expressed musically? Who is representing whom? What is the intersection between the original performing context and our understanding of these works today? This course encourages interdisciplinary dialogue. Readings will be drawn from post-colonial and cultural studies as well as musicology.","Andre,Naomi A",WGS,354,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Race and Identity in Music,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
"Global Perspectives on Gender, Health, and Reproduction","Feminists and anthropologists have produced voluminous work on the body as a site of gendered and sexualized practices.  Building on this rich corpus of literature, the course uses the body as a point of entry to examine the constructions and meanings of gender, health and reproduction, and their constitution of social differentiation.  By using various cross-cultural examples, we will discuss how gender, racial, and class differences are enacted and manifested in the divisions of social spaces and in bodily conduct, function, hygiene, and sickness.  In its entirety, the course attempts to introduce students to the complexity of the local and global processes underlying the cultural production of gender identities and social differentiation.","Fadlalla,Amal Hassan",WGS,365,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,One course in either Women's & Gender Studies or AAS.,,May not be repeated for credit.,With permission of instructor.
Sex and Sexuality in U.S. Popular Culture,"We will explore how changing ideas about sex, sexuality, and gender appeared in certain types of twentieth-century popular culture. As a group, we will learn to interpret media, such as movies or television, as historical texts that provide insight into past notions about sex in the United States. To this end, we will start with the assumption that media functions as mechanisms of socialization and as a venue for expressing popular concerns or beliefs about gender roles, same-sex desire, race, and so forth. We will uncover how the media represented historical issues such as courtship among heterosexuals, pornography, gay liberation, and birth control through a weekly film lab. At the same time, we will seek to uncover the voices of groups that the mainstream media have often omitted (or actively sought to silence) in discussions about sex. To that end, much of our course reading will draw from academics engaged in an assortment of overlapping fields. Students will be introduced to scholarship in race and ethnic studies, queer studies, feminist studies, and so forth.
Students should be aware that certain course materials contain sexually explicit language and/or images. Some images include nudity and/or sexually graphic content.Course Requirements:Short response papers, class participation, viewing films, a mid-term paper, and a final project.

We will explore the family structure, gender expectations, and cultural practices. We will look closely at intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and class and the role they play in the development of self-identity.  The changing concepts of equality and difference, as employed by women and men in articulating gender relations, will serve as a theoretical framework for our examination.","Kelley,Mary C",WGS,371,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Women and the Bible,"This course is an interdisciplinary seminar that approaches the women of the Bible — from Eve, Sara, and Hagar through Miriam, Ruth, Judith, and Mary — within the broad critical perspective of gender and sexuality. We will discuss works by prominent feminist scholars who have critiqued patriarchal, heteronormative male culture and illuminated the field of biblical studies.

We will ask what kind of alternative tools, sensibilities, and knowledge one needs to engage with the “women’s communities” of the Bible, and what kind of old conventions one must leave behind.  In addition to learning how meaning is constructed in the Bible, we will explore the ways these foundational women have figured in history and contemporary culture in art, films, and poetry.","Tsoffar,Ruth",WGS,376,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Feminist Readings,3,HU,,,,May not be repeated for credit.,
Special Topics,"College students today have grown up in a “gay-aware” if not “gay-friendly” world.  LGBT characters are everywhere on TV and in the movies. The debate over gay marriage fills the news with discussions of equal rights, states’ rights, and recently-lifted federal bans. In Michigan and other states, benefits for same-sex domestic partners are publicly championed by some cities and universities but regularly attacked in the legislatures.
How did LGBT people move from the mostly-anonymous fringe to front-and-center of today’s popular culture and political debates? This two-credit mini-course explores 20th century LGBT history in the United States through documentaries and archival research. We will be watching and discussing documentary films such as: 

Out of the Past (1998, 70 minutes) traces over 100 years of gay rights struggles, set against the backdrop of a 17-year-old student who forms a Gay Straight Alliance program at her high school.
Before Stonewall (1984, 87 minutes) traces the decades leading up to the Stonewall Riots of June 1969 through archival film clips and commentary by leading LGBT community members.
Stonewall Uprising (2011, 90 minutes) tells the story of the police-raid-turned-riot that sparked the start of the widespread, public gay right movement in the United States.
The Times of Harvey Milk (1984, 88 minutes) tells the story of San Francisco’s first openly-gay city supervisor who was assassinated in November 1978.
We Were Here (2011, 90 minutes) traces the arrival and initial impact of AIDS in San Francisco.
The Celluloid Closet (1995, 101 minutes), based on Vito Russo’s book of the same name, explores the portrayal of LGBT characters in Hollywood films from the silent era through the early 1990s.
After Stonewall (1999, 88 minutes), a sequel to the 1984 Before Stonewall film, traces the first 30 years after the Stonewall Riots.

In addition, students will have the opportunity to explore UM’s Bentley Historical Library’s large Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Collections.

Advanced Topics in LGBTQ Studies,"Integration was central to both the theories and practices of mid-twentieth-century American race relations. This course brings together content and methods from dance studies and performance studies to consider responses to integration, from landmark civil rights legal decisions to social and art movements that questioned mainstream understandings of integrations' potential denial of racial difference. The course will be anchored in key examples drawn from American dance from 1930-1970, but will also include the study of complementary performances in theatre and musical theatre. The course will develop students' performance analysis skills through close readings of choreographic works, plays, and librettos, as well as introducing students to performance studies' approaches appropriate for considering embodied forms of public engagement, including civil rights protests and political speeches, as performance. Interweaving dance and performance studies in a final writing project will provide undergraduate students with a dance-specific paper appropriate for application to graduate programs in dance studies and performance studies. The class will also provide historical and theoretical concepts students can deploy in their work as artists and as critically-engaged audience members.

In fact, even though life-prolonging therapies have been available since 1996, approximately 700,000 people worldwide died of HIV-related illnesses in 2019, and 1.7 million became infected that year. In this course, we will focus primarily on the first 15 years of the known epidemic in Europe, Africa, and Latin America, where the pandemic saw a surge of public discourses and counter-discourses that shaped how the crisis ultimately unfolded. Drawing from very diverse sources, we will analyze how scientific, political, and popular representations of AIDS often recycled existing racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and ableist tropes in order to exclude people most affected by the virus and reinforce the very forms of social exclusions that made them especially vulnerable in the first place. We will also look at resistant representations in literature and the visual arts and at the radically new forms of community-based activism that emerged at the time. Finally, we will reflect on how the AIDS crisis is being remembered (or not) today and what it can tell us about the pandemic we are now living through.

"Advanced Topics in Gender, Culture, and Representation","The age-old saying, “beauty is only skin deep,” tells us that physical attractiveness does not account for more meaningful qualities like character, intelligence, and goodness. But throughout American history, “beauty” has been used as a proxy to determine racial differences and at the same time, to ascertain those more meaningful personal characteristics. Throughout this course, we will examine the various ways in which Americans have used determinants of beauty (e.g., body size, skin color, height, musculature, hair texture, facial symmetry, etc.) to racialize and subsequently, rank and place value on people. Starting with Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) and ending with current-day discussions of beauty and race (e.g., the Kardashians, racial discrimination in online dating), the course will cover several topics including the black is beautiful movement, pageants, interracial dating, colorism, and debates over cultural appropriation.","Purkiss, Ava  ",WGS,434,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Skin Deep: Race and Beauty in American Culture,4,ULWR,,WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240).,,May be elected twice for credit.  ,

Sociology of Gender,"For individuals, gender is often an essential aspect of personhood and personal experience.  But gender is also a cultural and structural system that differentiates members of society. At both the individual and institutional levels, gender intersects with race, class, and sexuality to structure identities, rights, privileges, and opportunities. Organized around investigation of the socially produced North American binary gender order, this course is an introduction to the sociological study of gender that focuses on gender as embedded in social life. Specific topics of study include gender identity, how children and adults ""become"" gendered and ""do"" their gender(s), gender as a symbolic system, gender and sport, desire and gender, trans, and intersex.","McGann, PJ  ",WGS,447,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001,,3,,,One introductory course in SOC or WGS.,,May not be repeated for credit.,

To do so we will analyze an array of texts both literary and philosophical as well as other forms of cultural expression like photography, painting, and film.","Sabau Fernandez,Ana",WGS,462,"Fall 2021, ",Section 001, - Feminisms in the Hispanic World,3,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Honors Thesis,"WOMENSTD 490 and 491 should be elected during the senior year by students writing Honors theses. Students may elect between 2 and 6 credits over the course of the academic year.
The Honors Thesis

The thesis may take a variety of forms, for example:  an activism project, a research project, or a creative or performance piece.  Whatever the form of the thesis, it must include a piece of scholarly writing that reflects the student’s engagement with Women’s Studies.  Given the interdisciplinary nature of the Women’s Studies Program, the honors thesis advisor has the responsibility of determining the appropriate methodology, length, and format of the thesis, based on disciplinary norms and expectations.  These expectations should be established clearly, and the specific plans for the thesis (kind of supervision and form of thesis) should be discussed and agreed upon by the thesis advisor and the student early on.  

Selection of an appropriate thesis advisor is crucial to the success of the Honors thesis.   Only members of the Women’s Studies faculty may serve as Honors thesis advisors in Women’s Studies.    Go to http://www.lsa.umich.edu/women/about/facultyalpha.htm  for faculty listings.

During the senior year, Honors majos register for WOMENSTD 490 the first term and WOMENSTD 491 the second term.  In these independent study courses they conduct the research and writing for the thesis under the close faculty supervision of the thesis advisor.  At the beginning of the Fall Semester, the student should provide the  thesis advisor with a Plan of Study that includes 1) a research proposal, 2) a list of research and writing goals for the Fall semester 3) a research schedule indicating when and how the student will accomplish his/her research and writing goals, and 4) a preliminary bibliography.   The advisor should approve the plan of study no later than the 3rd week of the semester.  At the end of the semester, both the student and the thesis advisor will submit reports on the student’s progress to the Director of Undergraduate Studies for review. 

To register for WOMENSTD 490 and 491 the student should submit the independent study form signed by the thesis advisor to the Women’s Studies office staff.  The staff will then add an electronic override and the student may register for the course the following business day. 

The student may receive a ""Y"" grade in WOMENSTD 490 until the thesis is completed. In the case of a “Y” grade, the thesis advisor submits a Supplemental Grade Report when the thesis is completed or the student formally exits the Honors Program.

The Second Reader

                The second reader of the thesis is a faculty member chosen jointly by the student and the thesis advisor by the end of the fall semester of the senior year.  The second reader need not be affiliated with the Women's Studies Program, but his or her area of expertise should be relevant to the thesis topic.   The contribution of the second reader may vary, but the student should consult with the second reader while s/he is writing the thesis, and the second reader should comment on thesis drafts as well as contribute to the final evaluation of the thesis. 

Completing the Honors Thesis

                The thesis is to be submitted to both the thesis advisor and the second reader no later than the last day of classes in the term in which the student intends to graduate.  (Graduating seniors will have already submitted their Honors Concentration Release form, Honors Card, and diploma application to the Honors Program, and completed a distribution worksheet with a General Advisor.)  The student should also submit three copies of the thesis, with a cover sheet that includes the thesis title, student name, thesis advisor name and telephone number, and second reader name to the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Women's Studies for the Undergraduate Committee.    

The thesis advisor and the second reader  determine whether the thesis should receive an Honors notation and may recommend  what kind of notation it should receive.   The faculty members of the Undergraduate Committee will read all theses that have been deemed worthy of an Honors notation and assign a notation of ""Honors,"" ""High Honors,"" or ""Highest Honors,"" to each one. Not more than one week after graduation the Director of Undergraduate Studies will inform the student, the advisor, and the second reader of the Honors notation the thesis has been awarded. The Director of Undergraduate Studies then forwards the student name, thesis title, and Honors notation to the Honors Program.

                The Honors notation is recorded on the student's diploma and transcript.  There will be no notation on the diploma or transcript if the student receives no honors.

                The student should provide one bound copy of the thesis to be kept on file in the Women’s Studies Program Office.
