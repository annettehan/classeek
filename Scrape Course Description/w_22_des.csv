Introduction to Afro-American Studies,"What do Kendrick Lamar, Ida B. Wells, Marcus Garvey, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison have
in common? Each of these figures are thought leaders about the condition of Black life in the
United States of America. What can we learn from understanding the lives, experiences, and
histories of Black Americans from enslavement to the present? This course provides an
interdisciplinary introduction to the field of African American Studies through careful attention
to the social, cultural, political, economic and historical realities of Black life in the U.S. In
addition to providing a strong foundation in African American Studies as a disciplinary field,
students will examine how Black communities have affected, and been affected by, the
development and growth of the United States as a democratic, social, and cultural project.
Topics covered will include antiblack racism, enslavement, citizenship, voting, policing, gender
and sexuality, civil rights, Black expressive and lived cultures, and racial discourse in the digital
age. Check out this link for an example of the layered work we will examine in this course:

Issues in African Studies,"Symbolic Language and Communication in West African Visual and Performing Arts will examine the wealth and depth of Akan (Ghana) system of encoding and communicating knowledge by systematic and formulaic use of words (proverbs and poetry), image (visual arts-wooden stools, textiles-adinkra and kente), and the vast array of complex regalia associated with political authority, and sound (the performing arts-songs and instrumental texts). The course will seek to unpack Akan symbolic language and communication systems by asking the following questions: How and what do these objects communicate? What is the nature of historical, philosophical, and religious knowledge the visual and performing arts convey? And additional questions that may arise in the course of the semester. The course will benefit from my field recordings (audio-visual) and my book and journal publications.","Ampene,Kwasi",AAS,206,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Symbolic Language and Communications in West African Visual and Performing Arts,3,,,,AAS 111.,(African Studies).,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to African Art,"Through the study of a selected group of African and African Diaspora cultures, we will investigate several pivotal issues and narratives that lie behind the surfaces of some extraordinary objects and practices. African people have their own stories to tell about these things, of course: stories of mythic power expressed as living form, stories of historical contact with other cultures, stories of struggle and redemption, stories of ordinary, everyday life. And over the past several centuries, we in the “West” also have had a decisive, often disturbing hand in the framing of African peoples, objects and stories. The coupled histories of colonialism and the slave trade, along with our inevitably distorted views and representations of what African people are and what they do, have affected Africa and its peoples to the core. When we look at and think critically about “African Art,” then, we necessarily must look at and think critically about ourselves. Ultimately, the goal is to understand aspects of African cultures in the terms by which Africans understand them — to know African ideals and realities as they are shaped in word, sound, matter and movement.

 In this course we’ll be taking a few steps towards that goal. In lectures and weekly discussion sections, in films, recorded sound, and perhaps even in live performance, we will examine objects and the many stories that surround them. Looking and listening closely, we will learn to see and to understand a wide range of African visual practices including architecture, textiles, body adornment, painting, graphic communication systems, photography, dance, ritual performance and, of course, sculpture — not only as these practices continue to unfold on the African continent, but also as they are transformed, and as they endure, in the African Diaspora.

Modern Africa,"This course offers students the tools they need to understand current events in Africa in historical perspective. The issues that define African politics today are shaped by the economic, political and social changes that attended the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Any student of political science, economics, psychology, business or literature who wishes to understand Africa must study its history, for that history sets the stage for the present.  The course will begin by examining how wide-ranging processes—the slave trade, colonial rule, nationalism, independence—transformed the social and political lives of African people. In the middle part of the course we will explore the dynamics of human rights in contemporary Africa, using a detailed study of a recent court trial in Kenya. Toward the end of the semester we'll study a series of current issues—the political crisis in Zimbabwe; the Rwanda genocide; the end of apartheid in South Africa—in relation to longer-term histories.   The core reading will be a set of primary documents dealing with issues addressed in lectures. By the end of the course, students will have learned how to interpret evidence, synthesize disparate sources, and create compelling arguments about the relation between past and present.","Peterson,Derek R",AAS,247,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Crime, Race, and the Law","This course will focus on the historical origins and ongoing impact of the racial crisis in the present-day American criminal justice system and its momentous public policy implications for U.S. society in the 21st century.

Introduction to Afro-American Literature,"In this course we will study the emergence and early development of African American literature, from 1773 to the Harlem Renaissance. We will do literary close readings of texts to think through many of the issues relating to the development of an African American literary tradition. What constitutes a tradition? Can there be more than one? Along with these questions, we will examine our own assumptions about this literature and the many ways in which these texts reflect the different experiences of African Americans intent on gaining a national voice in a slaveholding and racially polarized nation.","Boisseron,Benedicte M",AAS,271,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,AAS 111 (CAAS 111).,,May not be repeated for credit.

"Gender and Immigration:  Identity, Race, and Place"," Refugees, migrants, immigrants, diaspora groups, and transnational actors are all terms that describe people who undertake different acts of mobility or travel across borders to seek refuge. But how are these terms different? This course focuses on these various acts of mobility to show how they are labeled differently under different political and social circumstances. We examine the gendered cultural and political meanings people and governments give to mobility, border-crossing, and displacement in this turbulent time in the era of globalization and transnationalism.

 

In this course we will also emphasize the experiences of both old and new generations of immigrants in order to understand the historical context of migration, globalization, and the processes involved in the imagination of place and nation building. One important lesson that students learn in this class is that the political processes that define the often-conflated meanings attached to the refugee, immigrant, and diaspora population cannot be divorced from histories of nationalism and transnationalism and their deeply rooted constructions in gender, race, ethnic, and class relations. Race, ethnicity, and sexism are significant components, and the course addresses them through cross-cultural ethnographies, media reports, documentary films, art, and other texts to explain how citizens and non-citizens are marked differently based on both legal and cultural terminologies.

 

Students also learn that systems of racialization and discrimination don’t just happen at the moment of border-crossing or when refugees, migrants, and diaspora populations settle in new homelands; these modes of exclusion are also experienced in various forms in their countries of origin. Some of the forces that lead to situations of refugee-ness, migration, and dispersal include religious, ethnic, gender, racial, and political discrimination encountered at home.  The course examines the different forms of these discriminations and how refugee, immigrant, and diaspora communities encounter them, live them, negotiate them, and resist them through their own cultural practices and other strategies of activism.

 

We will particularly explore how questions of power, race, and class intersect to shape refugees and immigrants’ daily struggles for justice and human rights. How do refugees and immigrants attempt to create and “imagine” their own social world with reference to their new locations and their homelands? Our readings and discussion will focus on cultural and theoretical perspectives from the social sciences, specifically anthropology, history, and literature.  And we will take as examples the ethnographies and narratives of immigrants from different parts of the world, specifically Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome.","Fadlalla,Amal Hassan",AAS,304,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Refugees of Unjust Worlds: Globalization, Gender and Nation",3,SS,,,The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome.,,May not be repeated for credit.

Black Feminist Thought and Practice,"What is Black Feminism? In this course, we will explore the history of Black women’s gendered and racial politics in the United States and, in particular, how their beliefs and experiences have differed from other groups. How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism. Course readings are drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods with the goal of exposing students to the history of Black Feminist thought and the breadth of Black Feminist scholarship, activism, and methodologies. By the end of the semester, students will be conversant in the major concepts of Black Feminism and Black Women’s Studies and have developed the analytical tools to understand how race, gender, and class interact to produce the unique experiences of Black women in the United States.","Strongman,Saraellen",AAS,323,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

In addition, students perform other linguistically advanced tasks, such as expressing their feelings, seeking the opinion of others, giving advice and describing their health. As with beginning and intermediate Yoruba, culture is introduced and incorporated through lectures, field exercises and interactions.","Ayoola,Gabriel Olujide",AAS,326,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Urban Ethnography and the Black Experience,"In Yo Mama's Disfunktional, leading Black historian Robin Kelley criticizes what he calls ""the heyday of ghetto ethnography"" - a period between the 1960s and late 1980s when representations of urban Black culture proliferated. Kelley argues that with few exceptions, insufficiently complex representations of Black life detrimentally shaped public policy, scholarship and social movements. Ironically, the liberal (and sometimes radical) ethnographers who produced this work sought to put forth a counter-view of Black people as respectable, rational, resilient and capable, in hopes of correcting neoconservative explanations of persistent black poverty as rooted in inferior culture. Since the heyday, Kelley and others have charted new urban ethnographic approaches that attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the past, by drawing attention to: historical processes of systemic oppression, sites of creativity and political organization, the heterogeneity of Black identity, the politics of activist ethnography and the meaning of cultural forms to their participants and practitioners. This course will introduce students to the U.S. Black, Black-feminist and urban anthropological traditions, with a focus on the use of ethnographic methods to attempt to revise traditional disciplinary standards of evidence, ethics and approach. In doing so, the course aims to expand students' understanding of the foundations and scope of anthropological thought and method and to hone the ability to critically evaluate representations of Black perspectives and experiences.","Burch,Melissa",AAS,353,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Topics in Black World Studies,"The sweeping drama of apartheid – a system legislating the separation of people on the basis of skin color – dominates the history of modern South Africa. Race and racial difference infiltrated every aspect of South Africans’ lives throughout the 20th century, informing the nature of politics as well as the experiences of daily life. But out of the prolonged struggle to end white supremacist rule also emerged some of the greatest leaders and thinkers of our time. 

This course traces the origins of apartheid, its institutionalization in the Republic of South Africa, and the battle to dismantle it in the later 20th century. We will examine the political ideology and mythology of white supremacy, and the propagation of racism in law, culture, labor, and education. The class also follows resistance to apartheid, from the formation of the African National Congress (the party of Nelson Mandela), to the resurgence of the Zulu kingdom, to the use of music, religion, philosophy, public activism, and violence as forms of opposition.","Jimenez,Raevin",AAS,358,"Winter 2022, ",Section 016, - Modern S Africa,3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Expressive Cultures of the Black Atlantic:  Vision and Time,"This is a reading-intensive course that spans a wide range of Black Atlantic cultures by focusing on the roles of visual arts and performance in the production of historical memory. 

In this course we will examine a diversity of Black Atlantic visual cultures, both in Africa and in the Diaspora, with a focus on how historical memory and the experience of the passage of time are articulated in objects and performances. What, for example, are the poetics of trying to reclaim historical “African” origins when such a reconstruction is by definition impossible? The idea of allegory will run strongly through the course: the mourning of lost “ancient” wholeness marked also by the enduring hope that fragments of the past can be reassembled to redeem the present. This is not to say that the people whose lives and works we will discuss here are abjectly “living in the past”—though this very misconception has been rehearsed often in museum exhibitions devoted to the objectifying study of “Other” cultures. We will concentrate on the ways in which the realities of a shifting present are addressed throughout the African Diaspora: in struggle, in celebration, and always in movement. Topics will include the construction of ritual altars in Haiti and Cuba; the carnival arts of Brazil, New Orleans and Trinidad; the sculpting of memory in recycled objects in the American South and in the sonic spaces of hip-hop; and other phenomena. Course Requirements:Student performance will be based heavily on weekly reading summaries and participation in classroom discussion. Each student also will be responsible for a class presentation of one week’s readings. A final project will consist of a “performance” that will synthesize the semester’s material in a way unique to each student. This may be in the form of a lecture, a film or video, a website, an interactive sculpture, among other possibilities. This project will also include a written component. Intended Audience:The course is intended for advanced students with diverse academic interests: religion, performance studies, anthropology, Atlantic studies. Concentrators in African and African-American studies, music, and History of Art are especially welcome. Class Format:3 hours per week, seminar meetings, no GSI involvement.

Readings in African American Literature,"In this course we will study African American literature written after the abolition of slavery (1865), covering African American history from the late nineteenth century period known as the ""nadir"" (lowest point), through the early 20th century moment that gave birth to the ""New Negro"" of the Harlem Renaissance (1920s). The writers from this period expressed both pessimism about post-Civil War racial violence in the US and optimism about African Americans' new opportunities for civic and cultural legitimacy.  Their novels, short stories, prose and poetry demonstrate that African American writers saw literature as critical to shaping ongoing national debates about freed people’s rights to citizenship.  We will explore  how black writers depicted differences within black communities through dialect, invocations of the “folk” and assertions of a ""new negro"" in their efforts to craft new political forms of racial identity at a time that was supposed to harbor great promise for ""freedmen"" (formerly enslaved individuals) and their descendants.  In our studies we will try to answer a key question:  How did African American writers respond to the rise of Jim Crow and the racial violence that established white supremacy in the South? And, more importantly, what do those responses from the past tell us about our racial justice/injustice in our present?","Santamarina,Xiomara A",AAS,374,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Black Writers Respond: Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century African American Literature,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  
Are We Not Men?: Masculinity in African American Expressive Cultures,"This course explores ""masculinity"" in African American literature and popular culture.

Germany and the Black Diaspora,"Taught in conjunction with University College London and the University of Missouri, this course explores global Black histories in an unlikely place: German-speaking Europe. This course is timely, too: as African migrants make the dangerous passage by ship to Europe to plead asylum in Germany and more neo-Nazi hate crimes take place, more public conversations in Central Europe are addressing what it means to have Black people on German lands. But students in this class will learn that people of African descent have always been a part of Central European history. From Black saint iconography in medieval churches to entertainers such as Josephine Baker or Beyoncé in Berlin, Germans have long engaged with and responded to Black figures in European history. In so doing, they have participated in global conversations on nationalism, colonialism, race, and gender. Students in this class will learn to think about Germany’s Black pasts in general and Afro-German history specifically while also developing their skills as digital humanists: together we will use blogs, learn digital mapping technologies, and curate an online digital museum exhibit to think about the humanities in the 21st centuries. Students will also collaborate closely with students at University College London and the University of Missouri on these projects. By working with peers on two continents and on three different campuses, students will engage deeply with questions of national identity, race, culture, and diaspora in the 19th and 20th centuries.","Thurman,Kira",AAS,395,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

much longer history. In this course, we will examine key genealogies, debates, and questions
emerging from the intersections of blackness, gender, sexuality, and class in the U.S. and other
sites in the African diaspora. This course will cross both disciplinary and methodological
boundaries as we examine histories of Black queer and queer of color social movements;
literature that reflects Black LGBTQ experiences; Black queer performances; and the numerous
interventions that Black queer theories have made into questions of family, belonging,
citizenship, futures, and performance. Students registering for this class should have some
background in Black or African American/Diasporic studies, preferably at least one course in
AAS; or, at least one course in gender and sexuality studies with special attention to race and
intersectionality. Graduate students are welcome with instructor permission.","Kelow-Bennett, Lydia  ",AAS,482,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,ULWR,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Senior Seminar,"This course examines the quest for justice in Africa from three perspectives: concepts of justice and rights, institutions of law, and the experience of injustice. We shall consider issues pertaining to the historical quest for redress against injustice done to Africans by outsiders such as slavers, colonists, settlers, and their beneficiaries. We shall also examine the quests for justice when Africans perpetrate large-scale violence on each other. Thirdly, we shall focus on questions of how ordinary people in Africa seek justice in their everyday lives in the context of legal systems, often inadequate and incompetent, deriving from the colonial era and where courts of chiefs and “traditional” leaders co-exist with formal legal institutions and informal judicial forums as well as ad hoc mob justice.   Central to our deliberations here will be questions of how notions of universal human rights clash with local concerns about the status and rights of women, occult violence such as “witchcraft,” sexual morality (specifically, homosexuality), and the causes of diseases such as AIDS.","Ashforth,Adam Philip",AAS,495,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Justice in Africa,4,ULWR,,,Upperclass standing.,(Cross-Area Courses).,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).  
Senior Seminar,"
This course explores cities in contemporary Africa through the lens of work and livelihoods, mobility and circulation, informal economies and survivalist strategies, architecture and the built environment, film, art and culture, social justice and citizenship.  One goal of the course is to critically evaluate how and why cities in Africa are often portrayed in dystopian terms and in negative stereotypes. There is an unfortunate tendency in journalistic, scholarly accounts to portray cities in Africa as examples of distressed, distorted, truncated, or failed urbanism.  This view that “cities in Africa just don’t work” is a fairly widespread perception that has embedded itself in both academic discourse and in popular culture.  Rather than treating cities in Africa as undifferentiated places of socio-economic malaise, famine and war, infrastructural failure, and service breakdown, the course seeks to understand the complexity of processes at work that produce cities in Africa today.  This course fulfills the Upper-level Writing Requirement.  Because giving and receiving feedback about writing enables us to develop our abilities as writers, peer review workshops will play a central role in our course.","Murray,Martin J",AAS,495,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Contemporary Africa and the World,4,ULWR,,,Upperclass standing.,(Cross-Area Courses).,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Perspectives on Health Care,"ALA 106/109 are the core courses for HSSP. Issues facing future health care providers that will be addressed in class include the balancing of “nature and nurture”, health and the environment, technology and ethics, the allocation of resources, the relationship between personal autonomy and health, and the nature of human relationships within the system of health care. Practitioners from many disciplines within the health sciences will present case studies illustrating these themes. This content provides a foundation for your professional involvement in health care and science by encouraging your informed consideration of the complexity of health and health care, developing challenges in the fields, and the spectrum of health professions. You will explore the major themes of the course by examining the following questions: What are the relative contributions to human health and illness from genetics, behavior, and the environment? How do the ethical dilemmas engendered by technologic innovations affect the freedom of scientists to develop, and practitioners to utilize, these technologies? At what point does our desire to provide the best possible health care to all persons conflict with the limits of our resources and other needs of society? What are the rights and responsibilities of individuals with regard to maintaining their own health, and how might these clash with the corresponding rights and responsibilities of health care providers and society? How do the norms and values of different health disciplines relate to the need to provide coordinated, collegial, evidence-based health care? How do these issues play out in your consideration of your future professional lives?","Harris,Lisa H",ALA,109,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ID, RE",,,Restricted to students enrolled in the Health Sciences Scholars Program.,,May not be repeated for credit.

In its guidelines for living in community and in its words of encouragement and strength for the individual believer, the Qur’an recognizes that creation is always imperfect and always working toward perfection. In this course, we read the Qur’an alongside the writings of (mostly) American Muslim scholars and artists, who interpret the book as a way to think through the pressing social, political and personal issues of the day. We discuss how American Muslims are contributing to the emergence of a new, global interpretation of Islam, able to respond to the social, economic and environmental challenges that face the planet in the 21st century. We read the Qur’an from beginning to end, along with selections from modern scholars that study the Qur’an from the perspective of ecotheology, feminism, and social and racial justice, and literary, artistic and musical works inspired by the Qur’an. We also listen to Qur’anic recitations and look at images of Qur’an manuscripts. For anyone interested in learning more about the Qur'an and emerging American Muslim engagement with the Qur'an.","Mallette,Karla",AMAS,229,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

They inform accepted notions of what it means to be a friend, what counts as work versus play (as work is increasingly “gamified” and unending), and the very possibility of political action in a hyper-networked system from which there seems to be no way of opting out.

Art and Life in 19th-Century America,"What can art history and American history tell us about each other? Painting, sculpture, photographs and popular media helped nineteenth-century Americans imagine race, nation, and spirituality while design shaped their environment. Ideas and images from this period inform the way we think today. We will study how the United States changed from a rural to an industrial, urban nation; slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction redefined the country, Westward movement and the accompanying confinement of Native peoples enlarged it, and waves of immigration and border movement changed its population. The rise of a middle class, a feminine ideal, and the accompanying notion of the ""American home"" were all products of the nineteenth century. American artists and architects sought to rival their European contemporaries and eventually produced distinctive works that responded to these national trends; today, contemporary artists of color are re-thinking 19th-century images. Through hands-on research in archives and visits to see original works of art in museums and libraries, along with readings in primary-source documents and recent critical interpretations, we will examine both developments in the fine arts and the impact of historical change on the material and popular culture of everyday life in America, as well as how nineteenth-century work now inspires contemporary artists. Among the artists and architects we will study are Thomas Cole, Winslow Homer, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Matthew Brady's photographic studio, Louis Sullivan, the Cheyenne artist Howling Wolf, Carrie Mae Weems, and contemporary Native American artists. The class will include a mandatory field trip to the Detroit Institute of Arts.","Zurier,Rebecca",AMCULT,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Zen Masters, Dharma Bums, and Drag Queens: Buddhism in America","The history of Buddhism in Asia covers a period of roughly twenty-five hundred years. The history of Buddhism in the United States, by contrast, spans about a single century. Although Buddhist symbols and concepts have become ubiquitous in American culture, those images and ideas are often only loosely related to their original meanings in places like India, Tibet, Japan, and Thailand. In this course we will consider the various ways Buddhism was and is transmitted to this country and how Buddhist traditions have taken shape within the contexts of colonialism, globalization, and distinctly American philosophical and cultural values. We will be looking at a wide range of sources, including novels, Buddhist teachings, popular culture, contemporary scholarship, and films. This course is designed to introduce students to some of the central themes and defining issues of American Buddhist traditions. While we will be discussing the origins and development of Buddhism in the U.S., this class will not attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of all major American traditions and their teachings. Instead, we will consider a small number of case studies that are representative of larger cultural trends.","Brose,Benjamin",AMCULT,234,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

The class has a comparative race and ethnic studies framework and significantly addresses issues of racism, class, sexuality, sexual diversity, misogyny, and homophobia. Class materials will include art, historiographic and expository essays, novels, narrative, documentary films, and autobiographical/ethnographic writing. Topics discussed in class will include:

Who are Latina women? What is unique about them in relation to other women with different backgrounds and men, including Latinos? What are some of their many intellectuals, artistic and activist contributions in the United States? How race, class, and gender intersect in their lives?

The American South,"Martin Luther King, Jr., Hank Williams, and Beyoncé. The Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement, and Confederate monuments. The US South has often been at the center of the major historical and cultural events of the twentieth century and into the present. Culturally, the region has been the birthplace of American music (from blues and country to rock and roll and hip hop), the home of great literature, and the source of various religious, culinary, and other traditions. Politically, the region has been a site of intense conflicts over race, citizenship, and memory. In this course, we will explore the cultures of the South and situate them within a historical context. We will consider the various every day and expressive cultural forms that emerged from segregation and black protests, from working-class life, from Asian and Latin American migrations, from interactions with the rest of the nation, and from numerous other economic, political, and demographic transformations in the twentieth century. With a central interest in the race, we will also consider how the region’s racial and cultural developments have regularly intersected with the ideas and practices of gender, class, ethnicity, and nation. Throughout the semester, two broad questions will regularly guide our readings and conversations: What is the relationship between race and culture in the South? In what ways is the South unique from other regions and in what ways is it emblematic of the larger nation?","Berrey,Stephen",AMCULT,263,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - A History of Race and Culture since Reconstruction,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Beginning with the Revolution, the Constitutional Convention, and ratification, and continuing through the period of slavery, Civil War, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow, we explore the interactions between social movements and legal change. Reaching the twentieth century, we turn to upheavals around territorial expansion, executive power, the New Deal, American Indian status, African American civil rights, wartime civil liberties, women's rights, LGBT Rights, and immigrants' rights. We examine constitutional amendments, Supreme Court cases, and political battles over citizenship and voting rights that have affected how ""the people"" are constituted. The course puts a particular emphasis on students' own interpretation of primary sources, from testimony before the 1871 Congressional hearings on the Ku Klux Klan, to contests reaching the federal courts in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.","Scott,Rebecca J",AMCULT,308,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,"Students should have a good general knowledge of United States History, such as that acquired in HISTORY 260 and 261, or equivalent rigorous high school history courses.",,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in Ethnic Studies,"How have misconceptions about Native Americans affected language descriptions? How do Native American languages enrich our understanding of language? To address the former question, we examine several cases of supposed linguistic relativity involving Native American languages, including grammatical gender based on animacy rather than biological sex in Ojibwe, time in Hopi, and words for ‘snow’ in Yupik and Inuit. To address the latter question, we consider Ojibwe (Algonquian), the language of the Nishnaabeg, who are indigenous to the Great Lakes region. We examine several aspects of the language which differ from English and many Indo-European languages, including word-building processes (polysynthesis), free word order, and gender-neutral pronouns. This course fulfills both the Race & Ethnicity requirement and the Social Science requirement.","Meyer,Cherry Lynn",AMCULT,310,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Unpacking Misconceptions and Stereotypes of Native Languages,3,SS,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Topics in Ethnic Studies,"This course examines transnational feminism(s) as both an interdisciplinary field and a mode of movement-building. The course begins with exploring the historical roots of transnational feminism in global, women of color, and Third World or postcolonial feminisms. Students will learn about the feminist interventions of the mid-90s into women’s and gender studies to destabilize the debates and practices of universalism, representation, and knowledge production. The second part of the course examines how feminist scholars and activists around the world, particularly from the Global South, shape our understanding of contemporary issues in transnational feminisms, both within and beyond borders. We will cover topics such as reproduction, family, and the state; nationalism, war, and militarism; colonialism, development, and capitalism; and migration and humanitarianism. The course will pay particular attention to the ongoing (and often unequal) exchanges between feminist, queer, anti-racist, anti-imperialist, and other social justice struggles in different parts of the world. Students will emerge from this course with a strong foundation in transnational feminisms as an interdisciplinary field and an understanding of how different feminist mobilizations across the globe are intimately interconnected.","

While trans rights may appear to be a relatively new phenomenon, even a “frontier,” transgender and gender non-conforming people and communities have a long history in American Culture. This course seeks to explore contemporary transgender movements, politics, and identities in historical context. Throughout the course, we will be particularly attentive to the ways that race, class, citizenship, and ability are connected to gender variance, and we will highlight the scholarship and activism of trans people of color.","Larson,Scott",AMCULT,311,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Transgender American Histories,3,HU,,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

Broadway and American Culture,"Do you think musical theatre has room for #Hamilfan and #BroadwaySoWhite? Do you feel the emotional power of Golden Age musicals like South Pacific and wriggle with discomfort at the stereotypical depictions of minority characters? Do you wonder why musicals by/for People of Color are so infrequently on Broadway? Are you curious about whether a feel-good, glittery, jazz hands wielding, pop-rock belting, “unserious” art form has something to say about serious issues in America? Can you stand listening to showtunes, a lot of showtunes? If the answers are yes, this class is for you. This course will explore the history of racial representation in musical theatre, how popular theatrical performance constructs race as an identifiable category, and techniques of analysis for “reading” performances to understand the cultural construction happening within and through American musical theatre. We will build a critical vocabulary and a set of analytical tools for critiquing representation in embodied performance and attending to the relationship between musical theatre and American culture. We will also pay attention to the material impact of artistic and production choices (i.e. casting, revisals, royalties) on the politics and practices of categorization, identity, and representation.

Asians in American Film and Television,"This course examines how film and television have reflected and shaped Asian culture and identity in American history. Through screening of feature films, documentaries, and television shows produced by Asian Americans and non-Asians, we study shifting representations of Asians across historical periods from the 19th century to the present. How have the movies and TV shaped American conceptions of Asians? How do images of Asians as “coolies,” “yellow peril,” “dragon ladies,” “gooks,” and “model minorities” circulate in American popular culture? Have Hollywood stars like Bruce Lee, Sandra Oh, Ali Wong, and Hasan Minaj broken down stereotypes or created new ones? How have independent filmmakers generated new and more complicated conceptions of Asian American identity and culture? In this course, you will learn to analyze:? How American wars, hate crimes, immigration policy and Asian American identity have been influenced by racial stereotypes?

Capstone Seminar in American Culture,"When in 1775 thirteen North American colonies moved to overthrow British rule, they delivered a major blow to European empire in the New World. Later, President James Monroe’s 1823 challenge to European monarchs if they attempted further expansion in the Americas seemed to confirm that the United States was fundamentally anti-imperialist. If so, then why did Monroe convince Congress to fund the privately owned American colony of Liberia, West Africa, the capital of which (Monrovia) bears his name? Later the United States fought an expansionist war with Mexico (1846-1848), which yielded territory that later became Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah. By 1900 United States had annexed what had previously been the sovereign nation of Hawaii, and controlled all aspects of life in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. Given the wars in Vietnam, and then later in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States is now vilified as the reincarnation of imperial Rome. If the U.S. claims it has no colonies, then what is the status of Guantanamo Bay, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Is “American imperialism” an actual truth today?

Capstone Seminar in American Culture,"The age-old saying, “beauty is only skin deep,” tells us that physical attractiveness does not account for more meaningful qualities like character, intelligence, and goodness. But throughout American history, “beauty” has been used as a proxy to determine racial difference and at the same time, to ascertain those more meaningful personal characteristics. Throughout this course, we will examine the various ways in which Americans have used determinants of beauty (e.g., body size, skin color, height, musculature, hair texture, facial symmetry, etc.) to racialize and subsequently, rank and place value on people. Starting with Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) and ending with current-day discussions of beauty and race (e.g., the Kardashians, racial discrimination in online dating), the course will cover several topics including the black is beautiful movement, pageants, interracial dating, colorism, and debates over cultural appropriation.","Purkiss, Ava  ",AMCULT,498,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Skin Deep: Race and Beauty in American Culture,4,ULWR,,With permission of instructor.,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Topics in Archaeology,"This course explores the connections between the discovery of new materials -- such as ceramics, concrete, precious stones and metals, glass, steel, plastics, and semiconductors -- and social transformations worldwide. To see these connections, the course will fuse basic concepts in materials science and engineering with perspectives and methods from anthropological archaeology. From ancient cities and Roman baths, to steel foundries and Tupperware parties, to virtual communities and nanomedicine, we will learn how the physical properties of different materials intersect with cultural variables like gender, race, power/authority, religious beliefs, values, and financial and political systems to shape human civilization. By connecting lessons from the past to the inventions of cutting-edge materials, we will also explore the future social impacts of new materials in medicine, construction, transportation, clean energy, sports, and other areas. This course will explore both how materials shape society and how society shapes material innovations.","Yalisove,Steven M",ANTHRARC,296,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Making Things: Three Million Years of Materials and Culture,3,SS,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

Introduction to Egyptian Archaeology,"In this course, we will focus on the material culture and spatial disposition of archaeological sites in northeast Africa, specifically ancient Egyptian and Middle Nile Valley cultures from c. 3200-656 BCE. We will learn about the people who created the objects we study, the logic and nature of both sacred and secular sites they built and inhabited, and the impact of new discoveries on our understanding of the past. We will explore in-depth specific sites, some well-known (such as Tutankhamen’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings, the pyramids at Giza, and Karnak temple), some less well known (such as the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities’ excavations at numerous sites through the Valley, the city of Kerma in northern Sudan, UM’s ongoing excavation at Abydos in Upper Egypt), investigating them as examples of different kinds of interpretive problems in archaeology. We will also consider theoretical approaches to Nile Valley archaeological data, the ways in which material culture remains articulate with other sources of information, issues of stakeholders past and present of cultural heritage including the politics of archaeology and repatriation initiatives; and we'll consider the implications of how ancient Egypt and archaeology appears in film, TV, and other media of public culture. Finally, throughout we will emphasize archaeology of lived experience, not just the privileged environments of political elites, but also the settlements, cemeteries, and cult areas of the communities and individuals who were the majority of the ancient Egyptian population.","Richards,Janet E",ANTHRARC,381,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Ancient Mesopotamia: History and Culture,"This course will cover the history of Sumerian, Akkadian, and Babylonian civilizations from the development of writing around 3000 BC to the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC. We will give special attention to: the rise and nature of early Mesopotamian city-states; law and law codes, including the Laws of Hammurabi; Mesopotamian literature, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Mesopotamian flood story; cultural diversity and ethnicity in Mesopotamia; international relations with neighbors like Egypt, Iran, and Israel; and the role of the arts in Mesopotamia, from music to music to food and beer brewing.","DeGrado,Jessie",ANTHRARC,384,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,Sophomore standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Early Civilizations,"Archaeology is the only discipline that studies change in human lifeways over very long periods of time, usually hundreds or thousands of years. This course is designed to introduce students to early complex societies, progressing from the origins of agriculture through the ancient states and empires of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Rome, the Maya, and the Mongols. We will be covering spectacular archaeological sites and discoveries such as Tutankhamen’s tomb, the Mongol capital, and Machu Picchu. We will also be covering less-known sites and discoveries that nevertheless provide important information regarding the development of civilization and the deep cultural histories of different parts of the world. Through course lectures, readings, and assignments, students will gain a better understanding of what factors contributed to social changes in the past, and be able to successfully reflect on the social issues of the present and the future.","Ventresca Miller,Alicia",ANTHRARC,386,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, SS",,,Sophomore standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Gender and Archaeology,"The fight for gender equality has become a matter of urgent public discourse. Much of this struggle has focused on current developments in the West, propelling changes whose speed and visibility appear unique. Yet, shifting gender dynamics occur the world over and are as old as humanity itself. The purpose of this course is to equip students with the theoretical and methodological background to examine how gender shaped human societies from deep prehistory to the present day. To do so, it will primarily use the tools of archaeology, thus focusing on the material traces left by the communities that inhabited our planet in the past. By deciphering a wide array of datasets, from domestic organization to burial assemblages, from dress ornaments to iconographic representations, and by zooming into salient case studies, this course illuminates the astonishing variability of human gender dynamics. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of how gender works, both in past and in present societies. Doing this through the prism of archaeology allows us to better grasp the many forms that gender organization can take, and the deep social and economic forces that shape them.","Saltini Semerari,Giulia",ANTHRARC,388,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Sex, Power and the Past",3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Topics in Anthropological Archaeology,"Madagascar was largely isolated from the rest of the world from its separation from the continent of Gondwana 180 million years ago until the appearance of mariners in outrigger canoes bringing a syncretic Indonesian and Africa culture about 2,000 years ago. Biologists view the diversification of its often unique plants and animals and a great natural experiment in biological evolution. Some anthropologists have viewed the diversification of human communities as a great experiment in cultural evolution, and others have argued against this. This lecture course will present information on the geology, plants, animals, human biology and language, archaeology, and history of Madagascar from the Age of Dinosaurs until the 21st century.

We trace the history of anthropology museums from colonial collecting institutions to places of community engagement and collaboration with communities of origin. Students learn about contemporary issues of representation, repatriation, and collaboration through case studies, museum visits, contributing to a website on objects in the Museum of Anthropological Archaeology, and conversations with members of the community of origin. During the Winter 2022 semester, students will work with ethnographic and ethnobotanical objects from Anishinaabe communities in the Great Lakes region.","Young,Lisa C",ANTHRARC,497,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,Junior standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.

ANTHRBIO 370 is designed to provide students with an opportunity to work closely with a professor over the span of a single semester on a research question in biological anthropology. Ideally, it should be undertaken after the student has been exposed to one or more 300-level course in the subfield. The course can serve as a stepping stone for juniors considering an honors thesis, or for juniors or seniors who want a single semester, one-on-one research experience with a professor. 

 ANTHRBIO 370 fulfills the important function of allowing students to more deeply investigate a particular research topic than is typically possible in lecture and lab-based courses. Students will identify a question of interest and review, synthesize and interpret existing literature on the question. In some cases, they will also engage in primary research related to that question, supervised by their professor.Course Requirements:	Student will have bi-weekly written assignments and a final research paper.Intended Audience:Advanced undergraduates.Class Format:Student will meet with Professor at least bi-weekly, depending on the stage of the research.",,ANTHRBIO,370,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,1 - 3,,Independent,With permission of instructor.,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Introduction to Historical Anthropology,"Cultural anthropology can be described as the study of how people “do things differently” throughout the many societies and cultures around the world; social history is the study of how societies and cultures have changed over time. History and cultural anthropology clearly have a lot to say to each other. How has “the past” become “a foreign country”? Through what processes did “so alien a Then become so familiar a Now” ? How are our present societies and cultures connected to our own pasts and to the pasts of others? What historical paths have led to the cultural differences we find around the world today? These questions are both anthropological and historical, and it takes the combined skills and techniques of both disciplines to address them. An anthropological awareness of cultural diversity also alerts us to the very real possibility that different cultures may have different ideas about “history.” How did the past happen? How “present” is it? How do we remember it? In writing? Through oral traditions? In other ways? How is the past inscribed in traces in the environment? How do social memories of the past shape cultures in the present? Are there conflicts within society about how the past should shape the present? How do social actors actively define and inscribe the past, perhaps in a struggle to control the present and future? How do conflicts over the meaning of the past reveal truths about social tensions, divisions, and processes in the present? In this course, we will study the convergences of anthropology and history from two angles: the uses of historical research to explain and illuminate cultural difference; and the use of anthropological research to understand cultural differences in approaches to history. Our objectives are to develop an anthropological sensitivity to the everyday workings of history, and to become more aware of how history is never “history” (in the colloquial sense of being over and done with), but is constantly being negotiated—and is constantly at work shaping the possibilities of our future.","Frye,David L",ANTHRCUL,226,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Anthropology of Religion,"An introduction to basic problems faced by religions and by the study of religion.  Drawing on case studies from around the world, the course examines different ways people have confronted questions such as how one deals with an invisible world, what happens after death, why do bad things happen to good people, what makes life worth living, how can one obtain wealth and power.  The emphasis will be on comparison, showing how very different traditions have dealt with the same or similar problems.  In the process of examining these issues, the course also raises questions about the difficulties involved in studying other people's most strongly held values and beliefs, and the relations between tolerance and faith.","Keane, Webb  ",ANTHRCUL,246,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Language in Society,"This course introduces linguistic anthropology, the study of language in comparative social and cultural context.  Some of the questions we address include, What is ""language,"" and why do anthropologists study it?  How and to what extent does speaking a particular language construct a culturally specific model of the social and natural world, a sense of 'reality'?  How do our linguistic perceptions influence the ways we recognize social differences, such as those based on ethnicity, race, class, and gender?  How do linguistic practices and perceptions of language reinforce social divisions and relationships of unequal power? 
In pursuing these questions, we cover a range of topics related to understanding how linguistic practices contribute to the social construction of racial and ethnic identity, as well as discrimination based on these perceived differences.  We consider, for instance, how judgments about ""grammatical"" and ""ungrammatical"" or ""educated"" and ""uneducated"" speech are ultimately grounded in social rather than linguistic factors.  Throughout the course we use examples and case studies from the United States and throughout the world.","Meek,Barbra A",ANTHRCUL,272,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Words Matter,4,"SS, RE",,,Primarily for first- and second-year students.,"

Topics in Sociocultural Anthropology,"How do systems of production and consumption connect us to the rest of the world? How do they disconnect us? In this introductory level class in socio-cultural anthropology, we will begin with the presumption that terms like “trade,” “supply chains,” “commodities,” and “logistics” are not purely technical or bureaucratic. Instead, we will explore how anthropological methods—especially immersive fieldwork and ethnographic writing—reveal the social lives and human/nonhuman labors that animate these categories and imbricate them in global divisions of labor. Classic works on sugar, coffee, cotton, and bananas will serve as our foundational texts. To challenge our understanding of what makes something “tradable” in the first place, however, we will also turn to more unusual items that pass through our shores: human organs trafficked from Brazil, exotic pets shipped from Guatemala, secondhand clothing donated to Zambia, and many more. Importantly, we will consider the very idea of the “border” itself, and investigate the purposes these serve in our globalized world. Our goal in the class is two-fold: to use anthropological perspectives to understand the everyday workings of global inequality, and to propose more meaningful ways to use transnational relationships to effect social change across geographic difference.","Paredes,Alyssa Dawn Esquivel",ANTHRCUL,298,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Transborder Trade: Anthropological Perspectives,3,SS,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

Childbirth & Culture,"This course focuses on the distinctive sociocultural configurations of childbirth practices and beliefs over time and in different societies. Exploring the great variety in how childbirth is managed and made meaningful across the world and in the United States reveals the cultural logics underlying practices and beliefs surrounding childbirth. We will analyze birth as a biosocial, biocultural process that reveals much about our understandings of gender, the body, medical authority, spiritual authority, community, and individual agency during pregnancy and childbirth. Throughout our study, we will pay careful attention to the experiences of the birthing parent throughout the medicalization of childbirth and its move to biomedical settings that prioritize the child and hospital protocols. Selected readings, films, advertisements, and other media will serve as material for our analysis. The goals of this course are twofold: To investigate how childbirth informs and reflects cultural beliefs, and to empower students, as future health professionals, birth support personnel, and/or birthing parents, to make informed and compassionate choices during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and the postpartum period.","Stuckey, Leigh  ",ANTHRCUL,325,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,Sophomore standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.

What determines what is normal and what pathological? How are morality and medicine intertwined? We will examine the ways in which individuals experience illness and seek (and provide) care in the context of local understandings of the body and self; consider the roles of social, political, and economic processes in the shaping of suffering and care; examine a variety of healing systems —including biomedicine—as social institutions that both reflect and influence what people “know” to be true.","Peters-Golden,Holly",ANTHRCUL,344,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Urban Ethnography and the Black Experience,"In Yo Mama's Disfunktional, leading Black historian Robin Kelley criticizes what he calls ""the heyday of ghetto ethnography"" - a period between the 1960s and late 1980s when representations of urban Black culture proliferated. Kelley argues that with few exceptions, insufficiently complex representations of Black life detrimentally shaped public policy, scholarship and social movements. Ironically, the liberal (and sometimes radical) ethnographers who produced this work sought to put forth a counter-view of Black people as respectable, rational, resilient and capable, in hopes of correcting neoconservative explanations of persistent black poverty as rooted in inferior culture. Since the heyday, Kelley and others have charted new urban ethnographic approaches that attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the past, by drawing attention to: historical processes of systemic oppression, sites of creativity and political organization, the heterogeneity of Black identity, the politics of activist ethnography and the meaning of cultural forms to their participants and practitioners. This course will introduce students to the U.S. Black, Black-feminist and urban anthropological traditions, with a focus on the use of ethnographic methods to attempt to revise traditional disciplinary standards of evidence, ethics and approach. In doing so, the course aims to expand students' understanding of the foundations and scope of anthropological thought and method and to hone the ability to critically evaluate representations of Black perspectives and experiences.","Burch,Melissa",ANTHRCUL,353,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

"History, Memory, and Silence in the Middle East","This seminar is an exploration in the anthropological approaches to the study of history and memory. It introduces and problematizes the concept of ‘silence’ in the empty archives, the ruptured oral historical accounts, and the fragments left behind by past events. Taking the demise of the Ottoman Empire as a starting point, the readings probe into the history, historiography, and historicity of minorities, refugees, genocide survivors, as well as undocumented populations and unarchived events to navigate the following questions: How do we trace and represent the past in the aftermath of violence and destruction? How do we conduct research when the evidence is destroyed? What constitutes ‘evidence’ for history? How could we entertain (im)material remnants of the past to rethink our understanding of the ""archive""? The readings are anchored in the ethnography of the Middle East and North Africa, with a comparative reference to the Balkans. We take the Armenian genocide and the politics of its historiography, commemoration, and denial as a case study.

Although you’ll read literature every week, the course is hands-on and designed to sharpen your skills in observation and analysis. For much of the semester, you’ll use multimedia software to look at different things on the same short stretch of video data, which you record yourself or capture from online sources. You’ll learn to detect and make sense of subtle communicative behaviors, such as pauses, interruptions, vocalizations like uh-huh, and repetition. We’ll look at embodied aspects of communication like gesture, as well as forms of digital interaction, and, more broadly, we’ll consider how interaction matters for big social issues like gender politics, democracy, and religious difference.","Lempert,Michael Paul",ANTHRCUL,471,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

This seminar provides background for the students to define their own senior honors thesis project. By the end of the term, the students will have decided on a project and begun preliminary work on it. In consultation with the honors advisor the student may request any member of the Anthropology Department to serve as a main thesis advisor or second reader. In the Winter Term, the students will convene periodically in seminar with the honors advisor to discuss their research projects and get feedback from the group, as well as staying in contact with the honors advisor and second reader. By the end of the term, each student should have completed the research and write-up for their thesis so that they can make a formal summary presentation of it for the group.","Mueggler,Erik A",ANTHRCUL,498,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,Honors,With permission of instructor.,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Principles and Methods of Historical Linguistics,"This course is about how languages change, what these changes tell us about the nature of language, and how historical linguistics (in combination with archeology and molecular genetics) is used to reconstruct ancient demographic and cultural patterns. Topics include: the traditional comparative method versus recent computational techniques, grammaticalization, how disruptions to morphosyntactic systems (due to sound changes or to language shift) are repaired, how ordinary language contact compares to pidgin and creole formation, whether cross-linguistic typology is a useful guide to historical reconstruction, and how historical linguists identify locations and reconstruct cultural features of ancient populations. A broader issue is how diachronic processes relate to synchronic description.","Heath,Jeffrey G",ANTHRCUL,519,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,"Graduate standing, or permission of instructor.",,May not be repeated for credit.
Language as Social Action,"The purpose of this course is to develop a a framework for viewing language as a social, cultural, and political matrix, and as incorporating forms of practice through which social relations, cultural forms, ideology, and consciousness are constituted. Through this perspective, analysis of linguistic practice can offer tools for ethnographic and textual research as well as for research on language itself. Topics covered include: models of language as action; the interactional construction of social actors and reference; meaning and intentionality; the role of language in a political economy, and vice versa (the political economy of linguistic forms); the relation of language to social formations and institutions; metalanguage and ideology; the emergence of meanings in interaction; the organization of conversation and other linguistic activities; the linguistic dimension of social and cultural stereotypes; performance and poetics. This year we will give particular attention to the following themes: analytical scales and metrics; the analysis of social events, and their relationship to social formations and linguistic practice. Methodological tools such as narrative and textual analysis, and conversation analysis, as well as the siting of research, will also be emphasized.","Mannheim,Bruce",ANTHRCUL,577,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,ANTHRCUL 576.,,May not be repeated for credit.

We will be looking at a wide range of sources, including novels, Buddhist teachings, popular culture, contemporary scholarship, and films.

How did this remarkable transformation come about? In such a rapidly changing country, what gives rise to a sense of cultural identity that endures and what are the nodal points of sharpest contradiction? This course provides a thematically organized introduction to Korean culture and society through an exploration of a carefully selected set of keywords. The approach will be cross-sectional, rather than chronological, and each of the keywords will open up points of entry for deeper dives into Korean history and tradition.

Modern India and South Asia,"The Indian subcontinent was divided into the twentieth century to form the three modern nation-states of South Asia: India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This region, home to a fifth of the world’s population, is critical to an understanding of our world today. This has been especially evident recently because the region has come to occupy a central place in contemporary discussions about the “rise of Asia” and the “war on terror.” Long before these contemporary interests, however, the subcontinent has played an important role in the history of the modern world. This course is an introductory survey of the making of Modern India and South Asia, starting from the eighteenth century, with the decline of the famous Mughal Empire and the establishment of British colonial rule, to the contemporary histories of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. We will throughout the course emphasize the interplay between indigenous and world-historical forces in shaping the economy, society, politics, and cultures of the region. The first half of the course will focus on the impact of British colonialism and of anti-colonial struggles, leading up to the independence and partition of the subcontinent. The focus in the second half of the course will shift to the consolidation of three new nation-states on the subcontinent.","Sinha,Mrinalini",ASIAN,259,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,With permission of instructor.,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Where did it come from? What does it teach? What does it mean to be a Zen Buddhist? In this course we will look at the Zen tradition from a variety of perspectives. We will begin by familiarizing ourselves with some of the most common features of the tradition: dharma transmission, the lives of eminent monks, meditation, and koans—especially as these things are represented from within the tradition itself. From this foundation we will take a more critical look at the historical and philosophical development of Zen as it spread throughout East Asia.  Taking broader cultural contexts into account, we will re-examine some of the previous themes in light of recent scholarship on Zen. This course will also introduce students to the various forms Zen has taken in the ancient and modern world.

"Race, Religion, and Caste in India and America","This course examines the relationship between Race, Caste and Religion in two very different democracies, India and the United States.

The juxtaposition of these very different locations and histories, each with its own public and private narratives of struggle, will allow us to analyze and discuss issues at the heart of public policy agenda, such as asylum, immigration, hate crimes and citizenship. The second part of the course will look at more recent forms of racial and religious profiling related to the effects of the post 9/11 War on Terror in both India and the United States.

At these sites, we will read ancient inscriptions, uncover forgotten settlements, and enter fresco-crowded shrines crowded with glimmering statuary. Then, will traverse through alpine meadows and glaciers to witness how development pressures and climate change are transforming ecologically fragile landscapes and diverse cultures. Thereafter, we will cross high passes and briefly enter adjacent lands including war-torn Afghanistan to see how the region's cultural heritage is being preserved and Tibetan Plateau to survey how ethnically Tibetan artists are responding to Chinese occupation.

Humanities Topics in Southeast Asian Studies,"This course examines how people in Southeast Asia have responded to harm, injury, and destruction. You will learn to analyze a wide range of approaches by which different ethnicities, faiths, and political systems in the most diverse region in Asia have come to make sense of violence and peace values. Some examples include the Khmer Rouge, the Santa Cruz massacre in East Timor, and the Rohingya crisis. We will also explore how the fast-paced changes associated with national development and in the economy, which are all parts of the process of decolonization, have also led to international awareness of other forms of violence such as the displacement of indigenous peoples, the impacts of leftover war waste and industrial pollution, or the “slow violence” of large-scale infrastructures on the environment like the construction of the Mekong dams.","Phung,Hieu",ASIAN,348,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Violence and Cultural Change in Southeast Asia,3,HU,,,At least one prior course on Southeast Asia.

"Chinese Food in Crisis: Health, Ecology, and Identity in an Age of Globalization","The current Chinese diet is nothing like it was fifty years ago. Today, Western influence makes itself felt in the diets of a billion Chinese– evinced by the ubiquity of fast food chains like KFC in urban malls, the milk cartons and sugary drinks downed by school-age children, and pork and beef manufactured through industrial systems of food production. Critics charge that the Westernization of the Chinese diet has contributed to expanding waistlines, skyrocketing rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Experts also blame Westernized cuisine and food production for the destruction of the Chinese environment and the countryside. Food critics blast Westernization for the erosion of a venerable Chinese culinary tradition. But is any of this true? This course will evaluate the impact of dietary Westernization from an interdisciplinary perspective, considering its implications for health, environment, and national identity. All readings will be in English.","Brown,Miranda D",ASIAN,351,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,"ASIAN 258, ASIAN 366, or coursework in Chinese Studies or Sustainability.",,May not be repeated for credit.
How Communism Changed China,"Is it possible for ideas to profoundly change the world? Observing the transformations that occurred in Chinese culture and society as a result of the idea of communism in the twentieth century, the answer certainly appears to be “yes.” In 1921, a group of inspired young intellectuals founded the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai, which was at the time China’s most cosmopolitan and fashionable city. From this point, communist ideals slowly spread across China – by way of underground communities and grassroots rural campaigns – leading to a nation-wide civil war that ended in the establishment of a new country, the People’s Republic of China, in 1949, which still governs China today. What were the dreams and ideals that motivated China’s communist leaders? What made common people support communism? How did life for the average Chinese person change after 1949? Why were women such an important part of Chinese communist culture, and how did their lives change as a result of the communist revolution? What is the role of the Communist Party in Chinese people’s lives today? 

In this course, we explore the different human experiences of communist revolution in China, asking what communism meant to Chinese people from different parts of society at different periods of the twentieth century and how communism changed various aspects of Chinese culture, including daily life, language, arts and entertainment, education, public space, and social relationships. Students will be asked to work interdisciplinarily in this course, using historical, literary, artistic, and anthropological texts, as well as personal memoirs. Emphasis will be placed on treating culture as a multifaceted phenomenon that stretches across traditional disciplinary boundaries.

 This course introduces students to research methods, primary sources, and analytical approaches used in the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Students are encouraged to view culture as itself an interdisciplinary problem, which requires inquiry into political thought, social life, as well as entertainment and the arts.Course Requirements:	Attendance and in-class activities (15%) Reading Quizzes (15%) Interview Project (10%) Three Short Papers (30%) Memoir Project (10%) Final Exam (20%) 

Students complete an Interview Project in which they learn about and carry out an important method of social science research -- the personal life interview. In addition, for the Memoir Project, students read and carry out analytical reflection on a personal memoir, reflecting on this as another type of knowledge production that intersects between the social sciences and the humanities. Finally, in each of their Three Short Papers, students are asked to reflect on questions from different historical fields: historical, anthropological, literary, and cultural studies. Through the required course readings and viewings, students engage in analysis of two feature and two documentary films, two pieces of Chinese literature in translation, and a Chinese dance drama film, as well as historical and anthropological writings about political policies, aesthetic movements, and everyday life.Intended Audience:Undergraduate students in Asian Studies, International Studies, Political Science, Sociology, History, and Anthropology.Class Format:	Two 90-minute meetings weekly, comprised of equal parts lecture and discussion.

The Travels of the Monkey King in China and Abroad,"The Monkey King gets better and better known throughout the world as new versions of his story continue to appear. The full story of how he was born from a stone, rebelled against Heaven, helped the Tang Monk bring true Buddhist scriptures to China, becomes enlightened and is proclaimed a buddha was first told in the famous 16th century novel, The Journey to the West. In that novel, the first seven chapters are entirely given over to the story of his birth and acquisition of miraculous powers and weapons. In the novel, even after he becomes the disciple of the Tang Monk he remains the center of attention. He went on to become a star of stage and screen. Although there has been a tendency, especially recently, to think of the story of the Monkey King as something that primarily appeals to children, the deeper meanings of his story have never been totally forgotten.","Rolston,David Lee",ASIAN,362,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Chinese Drama and Theater,"Traditional Chinese theater or xiqu (music-theater) was the mass media of China prior to the introduction of modern electronic media and remained important enough in the 20th century to be used as the main medium in political campaigns. Originally looked down upon, unsanctioned, and considered trivial, examples of Chinese dramatic writing have now been canonized and have taken their place among the most honored works of Chinese literature. In this course, we will pay attention not only to how these plays work on the page and how they were read, but also to how they were staged (and in many cases, continue to be staged). We will also investigate the fate of this traditional art form in contemporary China, as well as attempts to fuse it with other dramatic traditions. Students will be graded on class participation, class presentations, one short “subjective” paper, and two short “research” papers (with the possibility of doing a creative project in place of one of the latter).","Rolston,David Lee",ASIAN,363,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, HU",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
How Different is Chinese?,"Ever since their extensive contacts with China began in the sixteenth century, Europeans have been puzzled by the Chinese language. It seemed quite different from the languages with which they were familiar, especially its unique writing system. In the light of current views of human language in contemporary linguistics, this course examines European attempts to come to terms with the differences between Chinese and their own languages from the sixteenth century to the present. In the process of studying Western writings about the Chinese language, students will come to see how claims about other languages are embedded in historical and cultural circumstances. Along the way, they will learn much about the Chinese language and acquire the skills to critically analyze claims about the connections between language and culture.","Baxter, William H",ASIAN,368,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Natural Disasters in East Asia,"In recent years, the world has come to witness what appears to be an unprecedented level of destruction caused by a series of devastating natural disasters that have leveled entire cities, taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and displaced even more. Stoking the popular imagination with dramatic images, the global media has come to depict hurricane Katrina, the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and most recently the tsunami that hit northeastern Japan as the work of an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and essentially chaotic force. Although true in some respects, this way of understanding earthquakes, tsunamis, and other events tend to obscure the social, political, and historical side of these so-called “natural” disasters. When, in fact, did we begin to regard these events as the work of “nature” as opposed to, say, God or some other supernatural agency? On what basis do we classify a certain event as a “natural” disaster? Can we ignore the influence of class, ethnicity, education, and power on the making and outcome of these disasters? This course will bring these and other questions to bear on the historical and comparative study of natural disasters in East Asia and elsewhere. Some background in the history and culture of East Asia is recommended.","Ahn,Juhn Young",ASIAN,371,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, SS",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Modern Korean Literature,"This course charts the formal and thematic development of modern Korean literature. The twentieth century in Korea began with the end of Confucian monarchy and ended with the beginning of neoliberal globalization. Along the way, the country underwent a thorough transformation of economy and experienced great political upheavals—colonial rule, civil war, foreign occupation, partition, military dictatorships, and several major and minor revolutions en route to democratization. The course will focus on the relationship of literature to politics and history. Readings will consist of the works of modern Korea's major novelists in English translation. The aims of the course are to: 1) develop familiarity with selected works of major twentieth-century Korean writers; 2) situate literature within sociopolitical history and examine the relationship between texts and contexts; 3) improve skills necessary for close reading and critical analysis of literature.","Ryu,Youngju",ASIAN,375,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, HU",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

By examining materials such as short stories by colonial subjects who had to write in Japanese or “cultural introductions” by Japanese diplomats who sought to persuade their Nazi counterparts of their worth, we will come to understand how language, literature, and the arts—both German and Japanese—were important tools for creating and promoting images of imperial Japan both within and beyond the Japanese state.","Brightwell, Erin L",ASIAN,442,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Literature of Empire,3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Topics in Asian Studies,"This course examines films of three representative South Korean directors, Bong Joon-ho, Kim Ki-young, and Park Chan-wook, over the span of five decades. Some scholars call their films cult films. Others use “Asian extreme cinema,” a suspicious term saturated with Euro-American centrism, to refer to these directors’ non-normative narratives and styles. Regardless of these different nomenclatures, Bong, Kim, and Park are now regarded as the most important South Korean directors. One of the themes that bind these three directors together is transgression or deviation. Indeed, films of these directors explicitly challenge the social norms and tackle such issues as class division, gender inequality, inequitable society, and heteropatriarchy. Though it is impossible to view and analyze all their works, this course aims to follow their trajectory of filmmaking from their early works to their most recent work or swan song. By studying and comparing the works of these representative filmmakers intensively, this course also examines how these directors communicate with one another through styles, techniques, and artistic visions. Along with films by the three directors, students will also view Korean films of transgression made by women directors. Throughout the semester, we will also seek to answer the following questions: “what makes a great director?”, “who grants and recognizes the canonical status of films?”, “why aren’t there more representative women directors?”, and “can we decolonize Western-centrism in film studies by studying cinemas of small nations?”","Kim,Ungsan",ASIAN,480,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003,,3,,,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

"The Lives of the Buddha, from India to Manga","This course surveys ways in which many generations of Buddhists have understood the founder of their religion: the Buddha (“the Awakened One”), who lived in the north of India about 2,500 years ago. Although the search for the “real,” historical Buddha will be one topic treated by this course, our interest will lie in the sheer range of different versions of the Buddha’s life story. Told and retold in poetry, prose, painting, sculpture, music, film, and manga, this story has transformed along with the times and the storyteller. This course will begin in India and Southeast Asia; we will next proceed into East Asia, with some detours along the way. Much of the course focuses on Japan, where the Buddha’s life underwent centuries of reimagining and rewriting.

Mandarin Pronunciation,"This course, designed as a supplement to core Chinese courses and offered both Fall and Winter terms, gives students at varying proficiency levels the opportunity to fine-tune their production of standard Chinese consonants, vowels, and tones.  By learning principles of Mandarin syllable structure and articulation, students will learn how to recognize and correct their own pronunciation/tone errors.  Rigorous in-class drills and regular mini-quizzes, as well as several oral assignments (recordings submitted on-line), will build students' competence from word- to phrase- to discourse-level accuracy.  A semester-initial assessment will identify each student's needs (so that the course can be customized accordingly) while a semester-final evaluation will assess each student's progress.  Knowledge of Pinyin Romanization is presumed.

 In this course, we will discuss the on-going search for extra-terrestrial life. We will place a strong focus on the scientific hurdles that lie in our understanding the development of life and for its potential evolution towards interstellar travel and communication. The framework of the course will be based upon the Drake Equation, first posed to estimate the total number of intelligent civilizations that might exist in the Galaxy at a given time. Thus we will take a census of the potential for life beyond Earth through an exploration of our own solar system. We will then survey beyond our own star system to the exciting search for “extra-solar” planets and their biological potential. We will end with a group activity where students and professors will try to estimate how many ET civilizations might exist and then move on to discuss our future potential to travel to the stars.

Mathematics of Data,"This course is open to graduate students and upper-level undergraduates in applied mathematics, bioinformatics, statistics, and engineering, who are interested in learning from data. Students with other backgrounds such as life sciences are also welcome, provided they have maturity in mathematics. The mathematical content in this course will be linear algebra, multilinear algebra, dynamical systems, and information theory. This content is required to understand some common algorithms in data science. I will start with a very basic introduction to data representation as vectors, matrices, and tensors. Then I will teach geometric methods for dimension reduction, also known as manifold learning (e.g. diffusion maps, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), etc.), and topological data reduction (introduction to computational homology groups, etc.). I will bring an application-based approach to spectral graph theory, addressing the combinatorial meaning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their associated graph matrices and extensions to hypergraphs via tensors. I will also provide an introduction to the application of dynamical systems theory to data including dynamic mode decomposition. Real data examples will be given where possible and I will work with you write code implementing these algorithms to solve these problems. The methods discussed in this class are shown primarily for biological data, but are useful in handling data across many fields. A course features several guest lectures from industry and government.

Fundamental Physics for the Life Sciences II,"Have you ever wondered how physics is important and useful in the fields of biology chemistry, and medicine? BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 250 is a new introductory physics course that will reveal the synergy between these fields and explore fundamental physics principles that are ubiquitous in the life sciences. Biology, chemistry, and medicine will provide our guiding motivation and context for exploring first-semester physics topics including energy, mechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics. These topics will be covered in the depth and manner in which they appear on the MCAT and in life science courses. In line with this, students will also learn to use quantitative reasoning, develop mathematical models, and engage in scientific dialogue with a diverse group of future scientists and healthcare professionals. This course examines physical concepts through biological examples and consists of both interactive lectures and studio meetings to facilitate student learning and enhance student performance. Lectures will encourage student participation through a variety of in-class activities in which students work directly with, discuss, and respond to lecture material and demonstrations. During studio meetings, students will gain hands-on experience solving physics problems in small groups, facilitated by an instructor and peer learning assistants.","Meiners,Jens-Christian D",BIOPHYS,250,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS, QR/1",,,"PHYSICS 135 or BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 150.

But, the roots of its elevated status go back to the ancient world, to the Iron Age dynasties and the various mutations and developments in the city that occurred in the thousand years thereafter during the Graeco-Roman, Byzantine, and early Islamic periods. This course will study the city of Jerusalem in its ancient contexts. We will delve into archaeological remains, examine inscriptions, coins, and artistic depictions, as well as study the multi-faceted literary tradition both Jewish and non that preserved the story of this ancient place.

Food in the Ancient World: Subsistence and Symbol,"The course deals with the production, processing and consumption of food in the ancient Mediterranean world. Food is considered in its widest significance, as both biological and cultural phenomenon. The course begins exploring various sources of evidence, including direct archaeological evidence of food remains and preparation, analysis of stomach content in mummies and other well-preserved bodies, chemical analysis in pottery and human skeletons, relevant Latin and Greek texts and artistic representations. The role of food in relation to socio-cultural and economic developments is discussed by quickly surveying food procurement by hunter-gatherers, the introduction of cooking and the shift to food production in the Neolithic, and, finally, food redistribution in complex societies. The Greek and Roman world are the core of the course, exploring foodways across social, religious, economic contexts.","Motta,Laura",CLARCH,382,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Archaeology of the Roman Provinces,"The study of empires has traditionally focused on the society and culture of the conqueror, and the diverse means by which it maintained and manifested its power. More recently, however, attention has been given to the lives of the conquered and the degree to which these imperial subjects accommodated — or resisted — their rulers. In line with this development, this course revolves around a pair of related questions: how were the inhabitants of territories incorporated within the Roman empire affected by becoming part of a larger imperial world? And did provincial residents in turn have any impact upon the central power of Rome? This course will examine a sample of provinces drawn from various geographic and climatic zones as well as from societies with a range of pre-existing political formations. For each of these regions similar themes will be explored, allowing us, at the end of the course, to evaluate the nature of the Roman empire and the degree to which it was a unified entity.","Stone,David",CLARCH,424,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,"Upperclass standing, and CLARCH/HISTART 221 or 222.",,May not be repeated for credit.
The Art and Archaeology of Asia Minor,"This course provides a chronological survey of the art and archaeology of western Turkey, the place the Greeks called Anatolia, “the land of the rising sun,” from the late Bronze Age (15th-12th centuries BC) to the mid-Hellenistic period (2nd century BC).  The course begins by examining the collapse of Aegean Bronze Age civilization from an Anatolian perspective, focusing especially on the archaeology of Troy and the Trojan War, and on the Hittite empire.  We will then consider the reemergence of town life in the Iron Age (11th to 6th centuries BC) and the formation of independent kingdoms in places such as Phrygia and Lydia, the lands of Midas and Croesus.  Special attention will be paid to the role of Anatolia as an intermediary between the Greek cities of Ionia, on the western coast of Turkey, and the complex civilizations of the ancient Near East – in subjects as diverse as architectural ornament, the evolution of urban form, bronze casting, and the adoption of a written script.  In the 6th century BC, Anatolia was conquered by Persian invaders, who established a unified system of government that lasted until the coming of Alexander the Great in the mid-4th century BC.  In examining the Persian period in Anatolia, we will focus on the career of Mausolus, whose eponymous tomb, the Mausoleum, built and decorated by some of the most famous Greek architects and artists of his day, became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.  The last section of the course will consider the influence of the Anatolian heritage on the development of Hellenistic Greek civilization in sites such as Pergamon, which emerged as the capital of a powerful independent kingdom in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.  The archaeological evidence considered in this course comes mainly from excavations carried out at town-sites and monumental cemeteries, and the course will also investigate contemporary developments in Anatolian archaeology, including new research strategies such as regional survey in addition to ongoing excavation.","Ratte,Christopher John",CLARCH,435,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,Upperclass standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.

First-year Seminar in Classical Civilization (Composition),"This course examines the distinctive and varied ideas about love, friendship and affinity in a series of major classical and early modern works of literature. Some of the works on our syllabus, such as Plato’s Symposium and Dante’s Inferno, offer particularly developed theories and definitions of love. Others suggest their definitions of love more by implication and illustration. The course will use portrayals of love as a way to become acquainted with major works in the European literary tradition, and the topic of love will serve as a springboard for discussion of many other elements of these texts. Examining how each of the works on our syllabus makes use of its predecessors, we will consider how later authors use earlier classical ideas to create surprising and innovative new forms. Along the way we will compare these authors’ quests to understand and describe love with modern conceptions.","Wood,Carrie Elizabeth",CLCIV,121,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Love from Plato to Boccaccio,4,FYWR,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.

Classical Civilization II: The Ancient Roman World (in English),"Who were the ancient Romans? Most people would probably think of bloodthirsty crowds cheering on gladiators in the Colosseum, or Julius Caesar ordering soldiers into battle, or toga-wearing senators making speeches in echoing chambers. But who did the Romans think they were? On this course, we will look at the histories they wrote, their poetry, their works of art, and the messages they scratched on walls, stamped on coins, and inscribed on tombstones. We will explore their temples, palaces, taverns, and brothels; we will learn not just about famous generals and emperors, but about women who sparked revolutions, and slaves who were freed and made millions. Covering more than a thousand years of history, we will ask how a ramshackle village on the hills beside the river Tiber grew to become the most powerful empire in the ancient Mediterranean, and how Roman power continued—and continues still—to exert itself, long after the empire fell.","Fielding, Ian  ",CLCIV,202,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

The Mediterranean: Classical Studies,"The Mediterranean is a region of tremendous diversity and vibrancy, with a long history of travel, trade, tourism, intellectual exchange, piracy, conquest, and war. This interdisciplinary course studies the Mediterranean Sea as a geographical space and contact zone, and as a field of study, from antiquity to the modern period. It incorporates visual and material culture, as well as historical and literary sources from the Mediterranean basin, between Iberia and Mesopotamia, and from Venice to Algiers. The course is divided into three tracks—Art History (HISTART253), Judaic Studies (JUDAIC253), and Classical Studies (CLCIV253). Students follow one of these tracks by enrolling in the related seminar. The three tracks meet together for a shared lecture on Fridays, given by inter-departmental faculty and outside speakers, and break into separate seminar groups devoted to the respective tracks on Mondays and Wednesdays. 

This track, CLCIV253 The Mediterranean: Classical Studies, examines major social and historical developments in the ancient Mediterranean, through the lens of the Age of Heroes. In the first part of the course, we will explore the period that was thought by later Greeks and Romans to have been populated with legendary figures like king Agamemnon, beautiful Helen, and bold Hector—what we now call the Bronze Age. Our modern understanding of the Bronze Age is based primarily on archaeological data. However, in antiquity, this period was understood through myriad retellings—both literary and artistic—of stories like those associated with the Trojan War saga. Thus, in the second part of the course, we will consider how ancient Greeks and Romans reimagined those myth-historical tales in different sociopolitical contexts, from the age of colonization and birth of democracy to the foundation of empire. As part of the course, we will examine material, iconographic, and literary evidence; we will also explore objects housed in the Kelsey Museum.Intended Audience:Everyone. No prior knowledge required.Class Format:Seminars on Mondays and Wednesdays.

Topics in Classical Civilization,"In this course, students will learn both about the global nature of ancient economies as well as how to develop their writing to be incisive, precise, coercive, and accessible to different kinds of audiences. Students will learn how to create a historical and analytical narrative using quantitative and qualitative data sets while learning about the economic logistics of the military conquests of Alexander, the constructions of the Pyramids of Egypt, the price of urban development of the city of Rome, and the capital investment required for the long-distance trade along the Silk Roads and Indo-Roman trade routes. Given the broad historical span that the class will cover, we will be treating different economic aspects of ancient civilizations as case studies to explore the ways in which their economy spanned beyond their immediate local geography. The course will also explore how current economic theories (such as New Institutional Economics, Market Integration, and even Behavioral Economics and Transaction Costs Theory) are helping to understand the nature of economies in the ancient world. Questions of economic integration, natural resources, luxury trade, capital, taxation, investment, and loans, will be featured in our analyses. The economic data used for our analyses and study will be obtained from the textual record (composed of papyri, inscriptions, and historical texts) and the archaeological record (composed of coins, ceramics, urban and domestic archaeological remains, and even preserved organic material).","Soto Marin,Irene",CLCIV,350,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Global Ancient Economies,3,"ULWR, HU",,,CLCIV 101 and 102.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Uncompromising in the extreme, it has exercised a large influence over the subsequent history of Western philosophy, not only in the Renaissance and Early Modern periods, but down to the present day. We will examine their approach to philosophy through a close reading of Sextus Empiricus' Outlines of Pyrrhonism and selections from his larger work, Adversus mathematicos (Against the Learned), but we will also look at ancient and modern reactions to this form of scepticism, including whether it is a coherent philosophy and whether it is actually possible to live a human life in accordance with it.","Caston,Victor",CLCIV,369,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Roman sport also was based on exploitation of marginalized groups in society for the entertainment of the elites, another aspect where comparisons with modern sport can be easily made. In this class, we will discuss the various sporting events in the Roman empire, the facilities, the people involved, and how sports help to understand the broad structures of Roman life.","Verhoogt,Arthur Mfw",CLCIV,372,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

How did empires maintain and manifest their power? What effects did conquest have on the society and culture of the new rulers? Additionally, while the analysis of empires has traditionally focused on the conqueror, more recent attention has been given to the lives of the conquered and the degree to which these imperial subjects accommodated — or resisted — their rulers.

Air Pollution Meteorology,"
The atmosphere is a resource and, as with any critical resource, its use needs to be managed to preserve its quality. This need has lead to the extensive exploration of the important role that meteorology plays in the transport, dispersion, chemical conversion and deposition of pollutants in the atmosphere. Sources emitting a wide range of potential pollutants are being built and retrofitted every year creating a demand to assess their potential impact on nearby (and even far-away) communities. 

Sadly, the need to understand and predict the transport and dispersion of pollutants has taken on an even greater importance in recent years with the growing possibility that bio- and nuclear-terrorist events threaten large populations. This chilling possibility demands the creation of rapid-response warning systems based on our understanding of atmospheric motions.","Keppel-Aleks,Gretchen",CLIMATE,463,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,BS,,,Math 215.,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Energy and Climate Change: Technology, Markets, and Policy","
Energy is an incredibly complex topic by virtue of the inter-linkages of science, technology, public policy, economics, and human behaviors. This course will examine all aspects of energy: supply and demand, technical and social, with a concerted look at the natural place of social science (behavior, pricing, externalities, social norms) in the energy sphere. 

Every aspect of present-day society depends on the continuing availability of clean, affordable, flexible, secure, and safe energy resources. Yet nearly 90% of our current energy needs are met by fossil fuels. Our reliance on fossil fuels has led to declining supplies, rising prices, global climate change, and security concerns. The current global energy economy is not sustainable. The technological challenges are formidable; but they cannot be considered solutions without considering the human and social behavioral side of energy demand. 

The quest for solutions to ""The Energy Problem"" is dominated by technology ""fixes"". The visions of practical technological fixes, whether electricity energy generation, oil exploration and extraction, pollution mitigation, automobile fuel efficiency and alternatives to combustion engines, etc., necessarily build on what we know today and presume that we can achieve in a couple of decades or so, through sufficient R&D, an energy supply-demand balance that fulfills a wide range of incompatible requirements —  cheap, environmentally benign, politically secure, unconstrained supply, convenient, and safe. While we expect technology to come to our energy-rescue and support our established patterns of economic growth and energy-intensive lifestyles, we tend to expect very little from the human and social behavioral side of energy use and demand. In some ways the Energy Problem is yet another version of C.P. Snow's Two Cultures — parallel technology and social cultures with little mutual understanding and rare cross-over exchange. 

 The Complex Systems view would hold that society and Energy technologies have coevolved through the actions of individual agents (inventors, scientists, entrepreneurs, financiers, writers, politicians, kings and queens, dictators, and statesman), learning, adapting, selecting, exchanging information, and interacting through transactions of many kinds. At every stage, the social, economic, and technological systems were tightly coupled. It is not possible to understand Energy Problems without framing them in a systems context.Course Requirements:Two midterm exams, a Final Exam, graded homework assignments, and a term project.Intended Audience:Freshmen and Sophomores interested in energy and complex systems.

Computational Social Sciences,"Due to the growth in electronic sources such as cell phones, Facebook, Twitter, and other online platforms, researchers now have enormous amounts of data about every aspect of our lives – from what we buy, to where we go, to who we know, to what we believe. This has led to a revolution in social science, as we are able to measure human behavior with precision largely thought impossible just a decade ago. Computational Social Science is an exciting and emerging field that sits at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and social science. This course provides a hands-on, non-technical introduction to the methods and ideas of Computational Social Science. We will discuss how new online data sources and the methods that are being used to analyze them can shed new light on old social science questions, and also ask brand new questions. We will also explore some of the ethical and privacy challenges of living in a world where big data and algorithmic decision-making have become more commonplace. Each week, students will have the opportunity to try their hand at analyzing big data from sources ranging from online dating profiles to New York City taxicabs to #metoo Tweets and other sources.

Agent-Based Modeling,"Many systems can be modeled as being composed of agents interacting with one another and their environment. As a method, agent-based modeling (ABM) can explain phenomena in the biological and social sciences, ranging from evolution to epidemic spread to flocking to cooperation to racial segregation in neighborhoods. Very simple rules governing agent behavior can lead to complex and emergent phenomena. In this course, students will use NetLogo to examine and modify well-studied agent-based models of complex systems, as well as formulate models of their own.","Johnson, Joseph Davis",CMPLXSYS,270,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Though the topics and techniques covered are wide ranging —  we analyze among other things  the wisdom of crowds, the spread of ideas, the causes of racial segregation, and the emergence of riots, they aggregate into a deep  methodological coherence. The kind of understanding you won't get by reading the newspaper.  By the end, students will  understand the strengths and uses of various modeling approaches used in the social sciences and be able to use them. This is not a mathematics course, but it does require a willingness to think abstractly, to carefully contemplate lots of charts and figures, and to do a little algebra.   And above all, a commitment to never reading the newspaper in class.","cruz cort'es, efr'en  ",CMPLXSYS,391,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, SS, QR/1",Sustain,,One course in Political Science.,,May not be repeated for credit.

Introduction to Cognitive Science,"The goal of this course is to provide an integrated overview of some of the major approaches to understanding the mind and brain, approaches that together constitute contemporary cognitive science. The study of mind and brain raises some of the deepest and most complex issues facing science, and no single discipline can lay claim to privileged status when it comes to making progress. Indeed, much of the recent excitement in the field has come from approaches that draw on the ideas and methods of multiple disciplines. In this course we'll get a taste of some of that excitement.","Bollard, Mara  ",COGSCI,200,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, ID",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Language and Human Mind,"This course introduces students to the ""cognitive revolution"" and its impact on the contemporary study of language. We review the shift away from seeing speech behavior or ""languages"" as the object of inquiry to the experimental and theoretical study of the cognitive mechanisms underlying our unique human capacity for language, the exercise of which permeates virtually every aspect of human life, including what you are now doing! In every household, all of the children, barring pathology - but none of the dogs, cats or other organisms (nor the inanimate objects!) - acquire the language spoken or signed by the adults. There is some biological property of humans that makes this feat possible. What do we know when we know a language, and what does it mean to say that humans have an innate capacity for language?","Brennan,Jonathan R",COGSCI,209,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

"The Media, Past and Present","This class provides an introduction to the evolution and impact of the mass media and digital media on American culture.  Because the media have been, since the late 19th century, the major storytellers of our time, we will focus on the stories they have told us over the years, and provide you with important stories about the media, past, and present. We will review the ideological, technological, industrial, and regulatory developments that have produced our existing media ecosystem, and consider how media content has, over the years, inspired considerable controversy over who should get to tell stories through the media and should not. Our goal is to provide you with a sense of the strong connections between the history of the mass media and their present-day formations and uses in the United States and to provide you with the critical tools and language to deconstruct their storytelling assumptions and techniques.","Ankerson, Megan Sapnar",COMM,101,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Survey of Media Topics in the Humanities,"In this course, we think and write critically about television, focusing specifically on how the medium and its programming provides evidence of ideological conflicts related to race, class, sex, gender, and sexuality in U.S. culture. How do television programs represent cultural divisions related to race and ethnicity? How do comedic programs challenge viewers’ ideas about gender roles and identities? Why do people get so mad at television news? In readings, screenings, discussions and written assignments, we develop a working knowledge of different concepts that scholars use to study ideological conflicts as they take place on television. From the very start, we try to move beyond simplistic assessments of television itself as being either “good” or “bad” for U.S. society, or even particular images and narratives as being “positive” or “negative” representations of women and racial and ethnic minorities. Instead, we survey the complicated routes through which television programming shapes viewers’ understandings of themselves and the world around them. Throughout the term, you are asked to question many ideas and beliefs that people take for granted and/or hold dear: that television “causes” people to believe certain things, that particular images of minorities are “bad,” or that we could ever live television-free lives or form political opinions without consulting the news—even if we wanted to do just that. The overarching aim of the course is nuance—a deeper understanding of television and a refined critical lens for assessing its role in U.S. culture. ","Griffin, Hollis  ",COMM,306,"Winter 2022, ",Section 009, - Television and Social Change,4,"ULWR, HU",,,"COMM 101, a previous humanities course, or sophomore standing.",,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Global Digital Politics,"In much of the world, in advanced and industrialized democracies to developing and transitioning states, there is no longer a question of whether the internet affects politics—but rather, where, how, and with what consequences. These consequences are also complex, where the digital politics of local contexts are increasingly determined by the decisions of stakeholders residing in multi-sited locations across countries, regions, and economies. How do we make sense of these global and transnational changes, and the world as it is being re-wired today? In this course, we survey the growing literature on digital politics in international contexts, while considering how these lessons involve and affect other stakeholders in interconnected and disparate ways. The case studies for this capstone are the most current and cutting edge analyses to date, and our discussions will also engage with current events as they unfold through the semester and in recent years. Your task in this course is to draw upon frameworks and concepts encountered in your time in communication studies and allied disciplines, and apply and identify their capabilities and limitations towards understanding digitally hyper-mediated and hybrid socio-political phenomena taking place around the world today.","Hussain, Muzammil M",COMM,466,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,COMM 325 OR COMM 329 strongly recommended.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Political Misinformation and Misperceptions,"Inaccurate beliefs about politics are prevalent in America and held about a range of political issues and politicians.

The aim is to provide a critical understanding of how and why fans perform their investment in particular media texts and figures, from engagement in grassroots cultural practices (e.g., fan fiction, fancasting) to participating in industry-driven events such as Comic-Con. In doing so, we explore the evolution of fandom from a ridiculed and pathologized fringe activity to one that is now largely celebrated and integral to mainstream production and promotional logics. This includes readings on different forms of affective investment in media; negotiations between audiences and producers; and specific fan cultures’ meaning-making practices in relation to identity, technology, labor, the law, activism, and beyond.","Draper, Jimmy  ",COMM,473,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Writing World Literatures,"Since 2016, when they gave Bob Dylan a Nobel Prize in Literature, it seems that “the jury is out,” so to speak: songs are literature. Between our free time and working hours, spaces in our everyday lives are populated by popular music, whose variable rhythms supplement the unceasing rhythm of the calendar year. Songs are obviously a powerful mode of communication, and many musicians have had an outsize influence outside of the sphere of music in a strict sense: but what does this mean for everyone else, and how does the form of “song” relate to our day-to-day experience? What does song-writing have to do with writing writ large, and what music can we hear in the writing we encounter in our academic lives?","Woodworth, Benjamin  ",COMPLIT,122,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Song and Experience,4,FYWR,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Writing World Literatures,"In this class, we will explore fragmentary literary texts. Jewon Woo defines fragmentation in two ways: firstly, as “a breaking or separation into fragments and the loss of an original wholeness”, and secondly, as a process that may allow the reader to see and consider “the wholeness of a never-finished narrative” (2000: 15). In other words, while some things are lost when a text is fragmented, fragmentation also enables us to consider a text from new and exciting perspectives. ","Grimm,Lena",COMPLIT,122,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003, - Reading and Writing Fragments,4,FYWR,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Writing World Literatures,"Feminism may have different meanings to different people. Often, when we think about the word “feminism,” we assume that the forms of feminist activism and resistance are originated from Western cultures only. However, feminist activism has long been a global phenomenon. With a focus on the diversity of the kinds of feminisms, this course takes a comparative approach to investigate women’s narratives of activism from different parts of the world like the United States, the Middle East, and India. By reading the archives of global feminism, we will explore different concrete ways that feminisms worldwide have built histories and meanings that extend far beyond the North American continent. Together, we will read a variety of texts, such as articles and short stories in which we will explore questions like: How do we understand feminist practices in various locations, local and global? As a reader of women’s struggles, what is our role in reading these archives and narratives? How can we endeavor to uplift feminist voices and experiences? How can we create relationships with others that are equal?

Writing World Literatures,"We tend to associate some books with theory, tight analysis, logical proof, sound argument while other books with stories, gripping drama, believable (though not necessarily true) historical accounts. In this course, we’ll look at these two different kinds of narratives from a comparative perspective, explore how their features might operate successfully in the same text, and think about the challenges of integrating personal stories within impersonal narratives like a research paper. We will read writers that have used storytelling to create arguments in ways that the personal and the academic interact harmoniously, producing interesting and meaningful narratives. You will learn to recognize some of the generic features of personal and impersonal essays and fuse them in your texts while creating valuable works that have a lasting impact on your audience. We will examine strategies to re-create your life experiences while developing a sound and logical argument. Some of the topics covered in this course are creating intriguing plots, unforgettable characters, and dramatic dialogues. At the same time, we will read, summarize, analyze, and synthesize articles to generate and support your own essays. At the end of the course, you will be able to understand how personal stories compare to other writing forms, approach different writing genres critically, and integrate devices from many sources and genres in your essays. A significant amount of class time will be devoted to workshopping your texts, to discussions, and to reading authors known for integrating scholarly and personal narratives in their works.","Parra Garcia,Ivan",COMPLIT,122,"Winter 2022, ",Section 006, - The Art of Storytelling in Academic Narratives,4,FYWR,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

I am virtuous! This must be elevated, and that must be torn down! and so on. One curiosity about this phenomenon is that while debates rage—as they have for centuries—over what is right and wrong, good and bad, virtuous and corrupt, and even over whether there is any such thing as good and bad or if there is any discernable difference between them, many of us assume our position with astounding confidence, and subsequently express it with the full weight of moral injunction. The fact of debate is not strange but the ferocity—to not mention the assurance and conviction—is curious, given that we live in a time where most confess that absolute and universal truths do not exist. As one of the authors we will read would say: the death of God did not erase morality from the world and install an existence beyond good and evil; rather, what ensued is a strange, often desperate, and sometimes fanatical grasping for and insisting on moral values and laws.","Cvjeticanin,Srdjan",COMPLIT,122,"Winter 2022, ",Section 009," - When Good Things Turn Bad, and Bad Things Turn Good: The Ironies of Moral Positions",4,FYWR,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Faced with a possibility of our own extinction many have noted that the near future should spell an end to the many negative practices that have led humanity to this point: from rapacious capitalism, pollution and waste, to racism, inequality and discrimination. In order to become better people we must even question the nature of our own desire. This course is not interested in pandemics as such, but seeks to explore possible outcomes following a joint global event of a climate emergency and a pandemic similar to the one we are living right now, in order to explore the ways the humanity is capable (or not) of reimagining their life in the future.  ","Aleksic,Tatjana",COMPLIT,222,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Possible Futures Of The Human Race In Outer Space: Robots, Aliens, Replicants And Paradigms Of Exploitation And Inequality",3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Topics in Comparative Literature,"This course is a collaborative and interactive introduction to audio composition, taught by a fellow passionate amateur of audio storytelling. We will start by cultivating a practice of close listening as we investigate the building blocks of what makes great radio and podcast stories. You will be exposed to a wide variety of formats, styles and subjects of audio narrative and documentary—from radio art, to This American Life, to experimental and amateur podcasts—and challenged to begin listening like a radio producer: what brings these stories to life? what choices did the creators make? what are the sonic raw materials of the piece, and how were they put together? etc. Through a series of deepening prompts, workshops, and exercises, we will simultaneously begin developing the skills to produce audio narrative compositions of our own: storytelling, recording, interviewing, and editing—supported by the facilities and staff of the Duderstadt Center and other multimedia resources on UM’s campus. Throughout the term, each student will be working on a mini-podcast final project: a chance to practice and deepen our growing audio skills. This practical training will be accompanied by reading and listening exercises that will gradually deepen your understanding of the history and politics of radio and podcasting, supplemented with analytic tools from the critical discourses of media theory and sound studies, and queer and feminist theory, as we seek to critically contextualize the past, present and future of podcasting as an art form and an industry. All technical equipment will be made available to you at no cost, though you should ideally have a smartphone for in-class audio recording practice. No prior audio experience is necessary, but an existing curiosity about podcasts and/or longform radio journalism, and a strong desire to learn audio production skills, are recommended.","Fertig, Elisabeth  ",COMPLIT,241,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Adventures in Audio Storytelling,3,HU,,,COMPLIT 240.,W.,May not be repeated for credit.

Translating World Literatures,"This course provides an opportunity for you to build on your skills in reading a foreign language by translating literary texts into English, and in the process integrating broad theoretical concepts about translation into the textual practice of translating. The readings and writing assignments work together to introduce you to the history and theory of the practice of translation, extending a language-based approach to translation into a literary framework that emphasizes the process of reading and re-writing texts. While you are expected to write critical responses to these literary texts, periodically you will also be asked to engage with the readings through short creative exercises focusing on key issues in translation studies. All types of assignments demand a regular commitment to drafting, editing and revising. The critical and creative writing assignments are designed to build on one another, enabling students to become more attentive readers, to produce increasingly articulate responses to the translated texts, which in turn inform your own translation strategies. These posts will form the basis for the midterm paper reflecting on your views of translation, and will help you as you formulate your approach. For the final project, students will be expected to translate 8-12 pages of literature of their choosing from the language of their expertise, prefaced with an accompanying 5-8 page introduction that situates your practice in terms of the history of translation in English.","Merrill she-her-hers, Christi  ",COMPLIT,322,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Translating World Literature: a workshop in English,3,"ULWR, HU",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

This begs the question: what precisely are borders made of? How are they maintained, moved, or crossed? In this course we explore these questions through two comparative geographies: The Mediterranean and U.S./Mexico. Moving between literature, film, anthropology, archeology, law and climatology, we will examine the strategies by which communities are partitioned and policed in political space, in workplaces, and in language and cultural spaces, and the strategies by which they bleed across such partitions.","Stroebel, Will  ",COMPLIT,372,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - The Border Crossed Us,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Unpacking the way they authored their subjective narratives about the female voice, the self, friendship, intimacy, and love, we will consider both the uniqueness and enormity of each work and author as well as for the plurality of the category of women.","Tsoffar,Ruth",COMPLIT,376,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Thriving on Difference,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Topics in World Dance,"Throughout the world, dance is often how people express their deepest cultural and spiritual values. Dance can mark life events, including birth, adolescence, marriage, and even death. It can affirm group solidarity or be a political statement. It can be introspective or warlike. In Embodied Contemplations: Expression and Understanding through World Dance we will explore ethnic, recreational, and theatrical examples to learn to look at dance with an informed aesthetic perspective and a deeper cultural understanding. Dances from India, New Zealand, Cambodia, Turkey, Mexico, South Africa, and the United States are among the movement styles we will study. Considerations range from what performers do with their bodies and how their movements relate to music to what has been the significance of these dances in their cultures and how they are changing in the digital age. Coursework will include a midterm and a final exam, a paper, and questions to ponder. No experience or knowledge of dance is needed for this course; all students from all fields are welcome and encouraged to attend. ","

First Year Seminar in Digital Studies,"In 1972, cultural critic John Berger’s pivotal BBC television series and book Ways of Seeing opened by declaring that “seeing comes before words.” Berger wanted to explain the ways that both art and, in a more innovative approach for that time, commonplace images like advertising surround us every day. This course takes Berger’s insistence on the importance of images and updates it by examining both how images circulate online and what sorts of images are generated for and on the Internet. We will look at YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, livestreams and streaming platforms, as well as other forms of social media, memes, emoji and the use of icons in digital communication, fan and user-generated media, and more. Students will develop the ability to critically assess and analyze these media formally, learn about how culture is visual, and develop an understanding of the histories, industries, and cultures that images circulate in and help to shape. This class will have a seminar format that combines lecture and discussion as we learn to carefully examine and understand the visual culture of contemporary, everyday, digitally mediated life. Across many digital platforms today, we are invited to contribute images, annotate or adjust them, like or comment upon them, and position ourselves through our relationship to them. The Visual Culture of Digital Media will help us to understand the complicated and sophisticated ways images work online, as well as the work users do to make and communicate through them.","Murphy,Sheila C",DIGITAL,158,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - The Visual Culture of Digital Media,3,HU,FYSem,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Digital Culture,"How do digital technologies shape contemporary culture? As nearly every aspect of contemporary life moves into the digital realm, it is becoming harder and harder to escape the digital. Digital technologies have produced seismic shifts in how we think, talk, interact, learn, debate, date, eat, shop, exercise, travel, do business, and so on. They inform accepted notions of what it means to be a friend, what counts as work versus play (as work is increasingly “gamified” and unending), and the very possibility of political action in a hyper-networked system from which there seems to be no way of opting out. In this class, we’ll forge a critical framework for understanding the historical, political, and social impact of digital technologies on American culture over recent decades.","Fisher,Anna",DIGITAL,202,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to Digital Media Studies,"This course is not a survey course -  it will not tell you one sweeping narrative that covers a historical, aesthetic, or cultural terrain. Instead, in Introduction to Digital Studies you will examine the contradictory claims made around new technologies, the history of digital media, the formal qualities of emerging technologies, and the ways that identity, community, and bodies are understood as everything from legal entities to social actors in relation to the digital. Since this course is being taught in a moment of extreme reliance upon digital technologies, I hope you share my understanding that, in 2022, the digital touches so many parts of human existence and our planetary realm.","Murphy,Sheila C",DIGITAL,220,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Video Games and Learning,"Why are videogames fun?  The answer isn't as obvious as you might think.  Good games draw you in, teach you how to succeed, and keep you engaged with a ""just right"" level of challenge.  Most importantly, players *learn* while playing a well-designed game.  Why isn't school like that?  This class takes a hard look at videogames, a hard look at education, and considers ways that each can be improved to maximize learning.","

New Media History,"This class is a history of the digital. Today’s “new media” are cultural technologies of extraordinary complexity with a much longer history than we might first imagine. While first acknowledging that all media were once new, this class goes on to explore in-depth a more recent period in this very long history – the rise of what is often referred to as “digital media.” Computers, software, networks and the innovative sociocultural, economic, and artistic exchanges that occur through them have emerged from and actively remediated prior forms like radio, film, and television. At the same time, digital cultures have also introduced and spread new kinds of content and experiences. The affordances of digital life feel ubiquitous today, but has it always been that way? We will consider the historical development of computers, the Internet, and the many social, political, and industrial implications these contemporary technologies of entertainment and communication open up. Familiarizing yourself with this history will allow you to better understand current issues facing you today as a new media user and producer, and to integrate this knowledge into your academic studies, career aspirations, creative production, social life, and everyday existence.","Murray, Sarah  ",DIGITAL,354,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,FTVM 150 or FTVM (SAC) 236.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in Digital Creative Expression,"The last two decades have seen an absolute explosion in both interest in and production of hobbyist board games, due in no small part to the role of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. In this course, we will explore how the design of modern board games differs from the classic family games with which many of us grew up (Monopoly, Risk, etc.), as well as the role that technical writing performs in facilitating this unique form of play. In small design groups, students will create their own unique board game prototype, perform playtesting data collection and analysis as part of an iterative design process, and produce multimedia materials to pitch their game on a draft Kickstarter page.","Bushner,Anthony James",DIGITAL,355,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Modern Board Games and Crowdfunding,3,CE,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

New Media Theory,"The unparalleled rate at which “new” media emerge makes the study of postdigital cultures exciting yet challenging. This course turns a critical eye toward emerging technologies and their role in a contemporary postdigital landscape filled with societal crises. Acknowledging that all media were once new, we’ll use “newness” as a frame to examine our current experiences of everyday culture, communication, politics, and the social Internet. We will cover the key theories and concepts students need to develop a more critical and informed understanding of digital life. We’ll study everyday digital practices like media streaming, gaming, and WFH life as well as continually emergent tech driven by A.I., like robotics, AR/VR, and algorithmic engagement. Using screenings from science fiction and near-future film and TV, this course considers social life in crisis and uses the upper level writing model to address the following themes: human-machine interaction, the datafied self, history of user-generated content, surveillance and privacy, h/activism, big data, tech solutionism, environmental threat, and digital futures.","Murray, Sarah  ",DIGITAL,376,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, HU",,,FTVM 150 or FTVM (SAC) 236.,,May not be repeated for credit.

Intermediate Microeconomic Theory,"Microeconomic theory models the behavior of individuals and firms, and the properties of markets in which they interact. It provides foundations for current economic research, and for evaluating economic policies. We will discuss markets with perfect competition, without externalities, and without information frictions, and we will discuss markets that fall short of those ideal conditions. We begin by studying classical demand theory, which addresses how individual preferences and constraints lead to aggregate demand behavior. We’ll discuss firm and market supply and market equilibrium. We’ll introduce game theory, which addresses how strategic economic agents make decisions in environments where their actions are interdependent. Portions of the course focus on theories of monopoly and pricing.

International Trade Theory,"This course is an introduction to the study of international trade. International trade is central to understanding the growth and evolution of the international economy, from the “first globalization” of the nineteenth century to the “second globalization” that we continue to experience today. In this course, we will seek to understand the causes and consequences of these monumental changes in the world economy through a study of the fundamental economic determinants of the pattern of trade among nations. We begin by examining the classical theories of trade due to differences in productivity or factor endowments. We then extend our inquiry to the role of firms and imperfect competition in trade, including multinational enterprises and international supply chains, crucial elements of the second globalization. The final part of the course examines the theory and empirics of trade policy, paying close attention to how trade and trade policy affect the development process of developing countries. We will also analyze issues of contemporary interest (such as the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit) using the tools developed in the course.","Bartelme,Dominick Gabriel",ECON,441,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Topics in Microeconomics,"This course applies economic theory and methods to the study of crime. We will use basic supply and demand principles to think about why, where, and when illegal behavior occurs, and what the government might do to reduce it. We will also explore the empirical literature to understand what incarceration and policing do, how illegal markets (and their regulation) work, whether policies outside of criminal justice matter, and how benefit/cost analysis informs decisions about crime prevention. By the end of the course, students will be able to use an economic framework to analyze illegal behavior, to read and evaluate an empirical paper, and to think critically about findings from the crime prevention literature. Although public discourse about crime often involves philosophical discussions about justice, this course will eschew such arguments, focusing instead on how individual decision-making under constraints helps to explain crime and its prevention.","Heller,Sara",ECON,490,"Winter 2022, ",Section 400, - Economics of Crime,4,,,,"STATS 250, or ECON 249, or STATS 426, or ECON 451.

Introduction to Education:  Schooling and Multicultural Society,"This course argues that education affects the lives of everyone in U.S. society and that Michigan students can benefit from a close examination of how race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and class shape schooling
in this culture. Discussions in this class are not always comfortable because the topics are difficult ones, but students routinely claim that taking this course has been a transformative experience. When we
discuss today’s patterns of school funding, the effects of racism are immediately evident, and they take
on historical context when we consider the gendered schooling of the Colonial Period, the denial of
literacy to African Americans during the era of slavery, the powerful anti-Catholic sentiments that led
to the creation of a system of Catholic education in the U.S., and the boarding schools which attempted
to expunge the American Indian heritages of children. The historical context offers a somewhat
distanced perspective on racism and ethnicity, along with gender, religion, and class. Accordingly,
students sometimes take refuge in “that was then, this is now” with regard to issues of educational inequality. However, when the course turns to more contemporary issues such as theories of
intelligence based on race or assumptions made about students of Arabic descent or the experiences of
female students in math and science, it becomes more difficult to deny the ways that race or ethnicity or
gender contribute to inequality in education. Comparisons extend across time as well as across
populations. For example, learning about the recent increase in school-age immigrants and the
experiences of English language learners gives students a point of comparison with the role schooling
played in the lives of late 19th-century immigrants. Similarly, considering the educational challenged faced by American Indians and Latinos in today’s schools provides a synchronous comparative
experience. Overall, then, this course gives students multiple opportunities to consider the meaning of
race and ethnicity, to explore the various forms of inequality engendered by intolerance, and to compare
discrimination as it is enacted in response to many forms of difference.","Goldin,Simona",EDUC,118,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,RE,,,,(non-LSA).,May not be repeated for credit.

project leader and mentor to the younger participants.

POOT is run in cooperation with the Center for Middle Eastern and North African
Studies and the School of Education at UM-Flint. The core of the simulation is anchored
in the years 711 through 1492 and the cultures in and around what was known as Muslim
Spain, or “al-andalus.” However, the simulation draws from all periods of history and all
world cultures. The simulation revolves around a trial - different each time the simulation
is run -- based on events and people from history. While the details are everchanging,
timeless and universal themes, such as ""identity,"" ""freedom,"" and ""security,""
are the backdrop for POOT.

This class is different because you are responsible not just for your own learning, but for
the learning of younger peers who are depending on you. In order to fulfill that
responsibility, though, you will (collectively) need to understand and articulate a variety
of cultural and historical perspectives, as filtered through the personalities that appear in
the simulation. We have chosen to utilize character-playing simulation for two reasons.
First, we see great value in character playing as an exercise of the imagination. Being
forced to “walk in the shoes” of another, and to consider the ideas and the perspective of
someone from another time or place, can be a powerful catalyst to learning. Secondly,
both you and the student participants will be asked to do this character playing in a taskoriented
way. Mentors and students will learn about their character’s lives, their points of 
view, and the societal contexts in which their characters lived. You will then be
presented with a contemporary problem, which you will consider from the perspective of
your character. The idea is to help the students to construct a bridge between historical
times and the present day, to gain a heightened appreciation for other worldviews, and to wrestle with some (hopefully) interesting questions in a way that will deepen our learning
about history…and about ourselves.
It is often said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. To that, one might add
that the next best way to learn something is to play a game with it. This class tries to
combine both of those methods.","Stanzler, Jeff  ",EDUC,462,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,Experiential,,,,May be repeated for credit.
Web Based Mentorship:  Learning Through Character Play,"Students serve as teaching mentors for a web-based character-playing simulation involving high school and middle school students on a worldwide network, and they themselves also research and portray historical figures. The Place Out of Time simulated trial is different every term, but mentors and students are always presented with a contemporary problem that they must think through in the role of their characters, one that frames an array of social, political, cultural and moral question. Mentors are active participants in a dynamic, writing-intensive enterprise that is aimed at enlivening the study of history through juxtaposing historical perspective and sensibilities. The course employs purposeful ""play"" to frame a hands-on teaching experience that is supported by extensive in-class and written reflective work.","Stanzler, Jeff  ",EDUC,462,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002,,1 - 3,,Experiential,,,,May be repeated for credit.
Web Based Mentorship:  Arab-Israeli Conflict Simulation,"This class is based on a computer-mediated simulation that engages middle school and high school students in exploring the Arab-Israeli Conflict through participating in it themselves. Students in high schools in Michigan, elsewhere in the US, and even outside the U.S. could be interacting with one another, and with you, over the course of the term. University student ""mentors"" (that's you) facilitate this diplomatic simulation (in which we create a scenario that becomes the ""reality"" of our world) and serve as gatekeepers, pushing the students to act in ways that are in keeping with the beliefs/constraints that the person they are portraying would hold and operate under. There is a complex structure in place for them to communicate with others, to issue press releases and otherwise express their interests and trade influence, and finally to introduce possible new actions into the simulated world. All of this is done with the support and with the assistance of the mentors.
    
    Fundamentally, the exercise is an attempt to give students a tangible window into the diplomatic process, with it's slow, thorny inner-workings. This course, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (AIC) simulation itself, are based on the idea that the most meaningful learning often happens when one is actively engaged in a purposeful activity. By participating in AIC as a mentor, we hope that you will get a chance to think deeply about (among other things) how people learn to take diverse perspectives, what it takes to foster thoughtful discourse, and the nature of diplomacy itself.
    
    AIC is also a project in the School of Education, and part of its purpose is to develop new ways that technology can support meaningful learning experiences with high school students. Within the context of the seminar, then, we start with a basic grounding in the history of the conflict, and then move on to figuring out how to let that grounding inform your ongoing efforts to both support and challenge the student participants.

Evolutionary Foundations of Medicine,"Almost 50 years ago, one of the founders of modern evolutionary biology, Theodosius Dobzhansky famously proclaimed that ""nothing in biology makes sense, except in the light of evolution"". Recently, it became evident that the same is true for medicine, because human evolutionary origin left indelible marks on our body and psyche. The goal of this course is to explore how basic concepts of evolutionary biology inform modern medical thought. We will cover the following topics: 1) Medically relevant genetic variation (from both Mendelian and quantitative perspectives), 2) Mutation and diseases, 3) Selection in past and present human populations, 4) Comparative method (homology, Polyphen, animal models of diseases), 5) Functions and adaptations (real vs. promiscuous functions, trade-offs, to treat or not to treat), 6) Evolutionary explanations of diseases (five evolutionary causes of imperfection and the corresponding diseases), 7) Evolution of aging, 8) Genetic conflicts in humans, 9) Pathological germline selection, 10) Pathological somatic selection and cancer, 11) Evolution of human pathogens (at the levels of individual patients and of populations), 12) Origin of novel human pathogens.","Kondrashov,Alexey",EEB,413,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,BS,,,"EEB 390, BIOLOGY 305.",,May not be repeated for credit.
Microbial Ecology,"
A greater focus on the microbial component of the biosphere is warranted, since “microbes run the world.”  If we are to build comprehensive and predictive models for ecosystems important to environmental and human health, we need a better understanding of how microbial communities assemble and operate.
This course will cover the ecology of microbes by highlighting their interactions with each other and the environment, and will present the latest insights into their role in ecosystems ranging from thawing permafrost to the human gastrointestinal tract. Ecological and evolutionary concepts and tools used in microbial research, including novel “omics” techniques, will be introduced. The course also aims at uncovering how concepts developed in plant and animal ecology do and do not translate to the microbial world.Course Requirements:Grades will be based on the midterm (15%) and the final (comprehensive) exam (30%). Exams will be short answer and essay style questions (10 on the midterm; 15 on the final). The rest of the grade will be based on participation in discussions and written assignments (10%); questions asked to guest lecturers (5%); the problem sets for the computer labs (10%); the independent project (carried out individually) (1/3 on written, 1/3 on oral presentation, 1/6 on questions, 1/6 on mid-term discussion).
Students will develop a concept from ecology in the microbial field, written as a short research proposal, and presented during the last week of classes.  The week before Fall break we will have a class session based on the first summary page of their proposals. One-on-one discussions will be held where the students explain their research question and critique their fellow students specific aims.Intended Audience:This class is intended for juniors and seniors in any of the Program in Biology concentrations, particularly Microbiology, EEB, and Biology. Graduate students in EEB, as well as in Environmental Engineering, Public Health, Medical School, SNRE, and Earth, are also welcome.Class Format:The class is scheduled twice per week for 1-1/2 hours each.

Evolution at the Population Level,"This course will systematically treat the foundations of population genetics. First, the five factors affecting dynamics of within-population genetic variability will be introduced: mutation, selection, mode of reproduction, population structure, and genetic drift. After this, we will consider interactions of these factors and will discuss applications of formal models to understanding processes in real populations. An inverse problem of inferring parameters of mutation, selection, and drift from the dynamics of a population will be addressed briefly. Finally, we will review quantitative genetics and the issue of evolution of the basic properties of populations, such as mutation rates and modes of reproduction.","Kondrashov,Alexey",EEB,490,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,BS,,,BIOLOGY 305.,May be used to satisfy an elective requirement in several biology majors and minors.,May not be repeated for credit.

Algorithms using selection and iteration (decision making, finding maxima/minima, searching, sorting, simulation, etc.). Good program design, structure and style are emphasized. Testing and debugging.  This course (website: eecs183.org) is an introductory course to computer science and programming. Students will learn the basics of computing, as well as problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Languages include C++ and Python.  Learning takes repetition, and approaching the topic from different angles. EECS 183 provides the repetition and the different approaches through multiple tools integrated into the course. We use: zyBooks is an online animated interactive textbook. ZyBooks have minimal text, and instead consist of question sets, animations, interactive tools, and auto-graded homework, so students can learn by doing. CodeLab is an online program for learning and practicing computer programming. It provides you with hundreds of very short exercises with immediate feedback. Problem Roulette is an online tool where you can practice multiple choice exam questions from several years of past exams.  Students will complete projects and create programs that are practical to life outside of class. At the semester’s end, students will work on a real-world final project. You will be working as part of a team.

Introduction to Computer Organization,"Course Overview
This course is intended to give you a basic understanding of how computers execute programs. Understanding computers means understanding the hardware/software process of how you and the computer work together to have the computer carry out a concept. In your introductory programming courses (e.g. EECS 280), you learned how to express a concept in terms of a high-level programming language such as C/C++. In EECS 370, you will see how a low-level language is executed by the hardware, and you will see how to put together basic, hardware building blocks to form the functional units of a computer. 
To achieve these goals, you will design and ""build"" simple computers at various levels of detail. In this course, building will not mean connecting chips and gates. Rather, you will describe the hardware in diagrams, finite-state machines, and hardware simulators (written in C). To further your understanding of other topics, we will provide practice questions that will be discussed in the discussion sections. 

Prerequisites
Students must have taken EECS 280. Depending on when you took EECS 280, you may not yet be familiar with programming C on Unix. We advise you to learn quickly. A brief overview of C vs. C++ will occur during the first discussion section of the semester. Also you can go to GSI office hours for additional help. 

Course Material
The required text for the course is Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface (3rd edition), by Patterson and Hennessy. The lecture notes are posted on the course web page. 

Class Projects
Four projects will be assigned during the term, each of which will require a substantial time commitment on your part. Many students find the work load in this course to be heavy. 
Grading policy
Final grades will be based on the total points earned on the projects and exams. Factors such as class participation may be used to adjust your final grade, especially if it falls on a borderline. The tentative point breakdown is as follows: 

Projects 10% each = 40% 

Homework (4 assignments) = 5% 

Exams 2 midterms, 15% each, 1 final 25% = 55%

Computer Architecture,"Class Overview 

EECS 470 is an introductory graduate-level course in computer architecture. This course is intended to do two things: to give you a solid, detailed understanding of how computers are designed and implemented, including the central processor and memory and I/O interfaces; and to make you aware of the numerous tradeoffs in design and implementation, their interaction, their realization in both historical and state-of-the-art systems, and trends that will affect them in future systems. We will cover instruction set architectures, pipelining (including basic pipelining, multiple-instruction-per-cycle machines, out-of-order instruction execution, and vector processing), memory systems (including caches and virtual memory), I/O interfaces, operating system issues, and basic multiprocessor systems. We will also do case studies on microprocessors and systems you may have used, perhaps including the P6 (Pentium Pro/II/III), Pentium 4, and the Sony PlayStation/2. 
A central part of EECS 470 is the detailed design of major portions of a substantial processor using the Verilog hardware design language (HDL). Portions of this work will be done individually as homeworks; the bulk of the work will be done in groups of three to five as a term project. You will use modern commercial CAD tools to develop your design. This project represents a significant investment of time on your part, and is a significant portion of your grade in this class. However, in computer architecture it is particularly true that ""the devil is in the details,"" and you will gain important experience and knowledge by coming face to face with that devil.

Introduction to Cryptography,"Cryptography plays a fundamental role in building secure computing and communication systems. With its fascinating history through centuries and intriguing connections to deep mathematical (""how quickly can we factor an integer?"") and philosophical (""what is randomness?"") questions, Cryptography is an important and beautiful subject. With increasing concerns over privacy, security, and authenticity of data and communications in our wired (and wireless) society, cryptographic applications are bound to pervade our lives. Cryptography is, and will continue to be, a vast and exciting area of research in Computer Science and Mathematics. This course is an introduction to the art and science of cryptography. At the end of the course, students should be well-prepared to apply the core scientific principles of cryptography to build secure software and communication systems as well as to pursue more advanced courses and state of the art research in cryptography. 

This course will study fundamental concepts, algorithms, encryption schemes, and protocols in cryptography. Main topics include: symmetric (private key) encryption, public key encryption, hash functions, digital signatures, and key distribution. The course emphasizes a rigorous mathematical study of the various cryptographic schemes and their security in terms of algorithmic complexity. A nontrivial part of the course will be devoted to algorithmic and mathematical background from number theory and algebra needed to gain a solid understanding of cryptography. Popular cryptographic schemes such as AES and RSA will be highlighted and their security will be rigorously investigated. Detailed syllabus is available from the course web site (link below). 

This is a 4-credit course approved as an upper-level CS technical elective for undergraduate students in CS-ENGR and CS-LSA. This course is also approved as a cognate course for Math Majors. Advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in Computer Science and Engineering and Mathematics are invited to take this course. Graduate students in EECS can also take it as a 400-level elective course. Grading will be based on homework assignments, a mid-term, and a final project/term paper.

Academic Writing and Literature,"What comes into your mind when you hear the word “medieval”? Beyond the chivalric motifs of castles, knights, and damsels in distress, the Middle Ages can also evoke images of violence, the Crusades, and the idea of a “Dark Age.” To understand how the period has come to bear such a multiplicity of meaning, we have to go back to the source.  In this writing-intensive course, we will focus on creating complex, well-supported arguments. We will focus on the intersection between critical thinking and persuasive writing, using literary texts from and about the Middle Ages as our point of reference. We will examine (some of) the ways the people of the Middle Ages viewed themselves, and, by contrast, examine our own definitions of “medieval.”  Working closely with peers and the instructor,  we will develop our writing through workshops and extensive revision and editing. We will learn to read medievalisms (both in texts and in images/iconographies) through the context of their own period and to identify what purpose(s) they serve.

Academic Writing and Literature,"What do a Broadway musical about rival gangs, a manga about a cross-dressing vigilante, and Taylor Swift’s song “Love Story” all have in common? They’re adaptations of one story--Romeo and Juliet. In fact, much of what we consume today are actually reworkings of older pieces of media and Shakespeare’s plays are some of the most commonly adapted stories in the Western canon. Romeo and Juliet has remained perhaps his most popular play to adapt - finding new life in films, tv shows, musicals, operas, ballets, songs, and art. Over the course of the semester, we’ll read and watch various adaptations of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in order to consider the connections between form, authorship, and audience: What does it mean for a piece of media to be labeled or recognized as “Shakespearean”? How do changes in genre and form shape the way audiences and readers will encounter this story? How has this story been changed or shaped to fit a modern audience and what is the effect of various efforts to do so?

Academic Writing and Literature,"Sports and professional athletic competitions are (and have been) an essential aspect of society and culture. Athletics are both a means to find individual expression and create social bonds. Sports are also a method of establishing and/or fighting against socio-cultural or political boundaries. Rivalries (UM vs OSU, Liverpool vs Man U, The Patriots vs … everyone, or All Blacks vs Springboks) often inform and shape not only the athletes’, but also the fans’ identities. Athletics are embroiled in doping scandals, questions of social justice or equity, economic debates, and controversies surrounding gender. Sports have become powerful rhetorical positions that structure the way we tell stories about ourselves and our society. In this Writing Seminar, we first read, watch, and analyze stories by and about athletes and the athletic industry. We will ask what sports have to do with economics, international policy, and much more. We will evaluate the role of the individual and the community; inequality and empowerment; argument and sentiment; history, and representation in relation to the sporting world. Using narratives, such as Among the Thugs, Once a Runner, or the recent Olympics, we will imagine social identity through other (racial, economic, or gendered) categories. How have sports offered narratives or tools to think through or about the Covid crisis? Why have sports become platforms to support, protest, or even reimagine our communities and identities during quarantine? Each of you will assign a sport or narrative for the class to consider, thus compiling a diverse repertoire of athletic positions.

Retelling myths, translation, allusion, parody, and revision are all ways to re-approach and rewrite old stories and ideas—to “make them new.” We’ll use this theme to draw together writers from the 20th and 21st centuries who revise myths, ideas, and each other.

Academic Writing and Literature,"“What is time anymore?!” “In these challenging times…” “The time of coronavirus…” The last two years have left many of us feeling temporally topsy-turvy. For this reason, this semester seems like a good moment to investigate our experience of time and the ways this experience is represented in literary fiction. Travelers leaping from one century to another, bewildered characters stuck in temporal loops, threatening and unpredictable clocks—in one way or another, writers working in a wide range of genres love messing with time. In this course, we’ll engage with texts from the nineteenth century to the present that feature weird encounters with time in order to examine how stories organize and try to make sense of temporal experiences. We’ll explore how writers use narratives of the past or future to negotiate the present and we’ll delve into the ways representations of power, agency, and identity are entwined with temporal ruptures, narrative loops, and feelings of being too late, too early, or out of step with the prevailing tempo.",,ENGLISH,124,"Winter 2022, ",Section 018,,4,FYWR,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Academic Writing and Literature,"Our class will survey the “castaway tale” as it appears in novels, short stories, plays, nonfiction, film and even New Yorker cartoons. We will trace the lineage of the castaway through connections to colonial ideology, piracy and the history of maritime travel and trade. The course spans from the late 17th and early 18th century to contemporary times, questioning why the castaway trope has acquired such staying power in the cultural and literary imagination. Our reading list is still in the works, but will include a few of the following texts: Robinson Crusoe (1719), The Female American (1767), The Isle of Pines (1668), Gulliver’s Travels (1726), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896),The Mysterious Island (1875), Friday; or, The Other Island (1967), Lord of The Flies (1954), Concrete Island (1974), The Martian (2011).

In this course, we will critically and honestly interrogate the writing process by focusing on its difficulties and how to overcome them. In our readings, we will engage with a number of literary, scholarly, and personal texts which are all concerned with the question of how we write, and why it is so difficult to do so. Our assignments will redirect the labor of a final paper onto the writing process, through reflective essays, peer review, and open discussions about our struggles as writers which will culminate in a portfolio students submit at the end of the semester.

Writing and Academic Inquiry," Learning to craft effective arguments begins with asking important questions.  So this semester, we’ll focus on a question central to your time at Michigan: What’s college for?  In our readings, discussions, and essays, we’ll look at how students, teachers, and writers have answered that question across American history.  There are more ways to answer our driving question than there are people who have asked it, so we’ll see how the answer can vary with time, place, person, and institution.  By the end of the semester, you’ll have begun to formulate your own answer—and to understand a little better what your goals are for the next four years at Michigan and how you might be able to accomplish them.

You will learn how to advance compelling, complex arguments crafted in a spirit of exploration and inquiry.

You will learn to trust your own critical thinking and judgment as you ascertain the needs of the assignments and their audiences.

Writing and Academic Inquiry,"This is a first-year writing course focused on the relationship between ourselves, our communities, and our desires. In this class, we will learn and hone our skills around advocating for ourselves—how to make persuasive arguments about the things that are important to us. We will consider argumentation from multiple angles, thinking about how the structure and form of our arguments need to change based on who we’re trying to persuade. We will study fields and topics such as contemporary racial justice, science, and technology studies, disability justice, and intersectional feminism in order to understand how writers before us have advocated for themselves and on behalf of their communities. As an introductory course to self-advocacy, we will think expansively about how to use writing and argumentation to achieve desired ends, using a variety of methods and sources. As a first-year writing course, we will develop the basic critical writing skills that you will use throughout your time at the University of Michigan and beyond.",,ENGLISH,125,"Winter 2022, ",Section 083,,4,FYWR,,,,"F, W, Sp, Su.",May not be repeated for credit.

First-Year Seminar on English Language and Literature,"In 1903 W.E.B. Du Bois famously wrote in The Souls of Black Folk that, “the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” This course asks you to consider whether or not this twentieth century problem is still a twenty-first century problem, and if so, how. Is the twenty-first century color line similar to or different from the twentieth century problem Du Bois described? This course asks you to answer this question for yourself. You can expect to have in-depth conversations about the social, cultural, and political significance of race in America. Since this is an English course, we’ll pay particular attention to how these themes are explored in literature. Course work will include active reading, discussion, and four essays.","Nichols,Dana",ENGLISH,140,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Race in the Age of Trump,3,"RE, HU",FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.
First-Year Seminar on English Language and Literature,"In this course, we’ll have fun with, and take very seriously, kids’ books about Jackie Robinson, Shirley Chisholm, and Wilma Mankiller. We’ll read a graphic novel (comic book?) written from John Lewis’s perspective about the U.S. black freedom movement, sometimes called “the” civil rights movement. We’ll figure out what we can learn about Fannie Lou Hamer and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Among other activities, we’ll also watch Hamilton, interview a best-selling writer about his work on heroes, and explore an online exhibit of Native American photographs with one of its curators. There are lots of ways we get to know our heroes. Is there a “real person” who emerges from representations in film, fiction, photography, biography, autobiography, and the web? We’ll use our heroes (and heroes of other people) to examine the relationships between “reality” and representation, authenticity and argument, truth and fiction, stories and – well, stories. We’ll talk a lot about story, in fact, and I’ll make the argument that story is all we’ve got, so we’d better be really, really good at thinking, talking, and writing critically about it. ","Portnoy she-her, Alisse  ",ENGLISH,140,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Our Heroes: What's the Story?,3,"RE, HU",FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.
First-Year Seminar on English Language and Literature,"In authoritarian regimes, dictators tell you what you can and cannot do. In totalitarian regimes, they attempt to tell you what you can and cannot think. Some of the world’s greatest twentieth-century novels are keen diagnoses of totalitarianism as it appeared on both Right and Left, and these literary classics are the primary subject of this seminar: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932), Arthur Koestler’s Darkness at Noon (1941), George Orwell’s Animal Farm (1946) and 1984 (1949), as well as Hannah Arendt’s monumental study of The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951). But we will also consider the persistence of totalitarianism in our own, present-day society, what the Polish philosopher Ryzard Legutko calls The Demon in Democracy: Totalitarian Temptations in Free Societies (2016). Are we losing our ability to think, speak, and act as free subjects? Can totalitarianism be confronted, resisted, or dismantled? In this class, students will read, write, and discuss in the decidedly anti-totalitarian spirit of academic freedom and viewpoint diversity. All persuasions are welcome: conservative, liberal, religious, secular, or “undecided.” You will not be graded on your opinions. You will be asked to think for yourself.","Lyons,Scott Richard",ENGLISH,140,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003, - Totalitarianism and Literature,3,HU,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.
Readings in Multicultural American Literature,"In this course, we will consider the unique literary, rhetorical, and aesthetic innovations of Latinx writers and artists—primarily in the United States, from 1960 to the present. How have Latinx writers, artists, and fictional characters navigated diverse experiences of labor, migration, and code-switching? In what ways have they joined, depicted, and critiqued major political movements? What might be the benefits (or limitations) of particular group identifications (“Latina/o/x” vs. “Hispanic” vs. “Chicana/o/x” vs. “Mexican American” vs. “Puerto Rican,” and so on)?

Introduction to Language and Rhetoric,"Our conversations in this course will impact the ways we look at the every day, every day. Rhetoric, after all, is everywhere. And we know that words matter. Sure, lots of us learned an old playground rhyme: “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” While that may reassure an elementary school child, once we spend even a few minutes studying language and politics, or language and advertising, or language and just about anything, we soon realize that naming has tremendous power. Martin Luther King, Jr., famously defends his “willingness to break laws” by naming some laws just and some unjust; lives hang in the balance pending whether something is named murder or self-defense; selecting a category of racial or national membership on an application or a census poll has many practical consequences.","Portnoy she-her, Alisse  ",ENGLISH,203,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Rhetoric and Rights: Language and Power in U.S. Civil Rights Movements,3,"RE, HU",,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Our comparative analyses of texts will pay particular attention to their play with genre and their use of literary devices – e.g., structure, voice, point of view, dialogue, temporality, language – to render narratives about girlhood in contexts of (im)migration, loss, displacement, violence, revolution, war, and trauma. To one degree or another, each of our texts represents experiences of girlhood at the borders and crossings of gender, class, race, nation, ethnicity, and sexuality.","Tapia,Ruby Christina-Marie",ENGLISH,215,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Narratives of Girlhood,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Literature and Writing Outside the Classroom,"In a time when we've been socially distanced, this course asks us to write letters--good-old-fashioned ink on paper folded into a licked, stamped envelope dropped into a mailbox. Two primary goals motivate our production of letters. Our first goal is to use letter correspondence to create new channels for dialogue. To whom do you want to write? What will you say to them? What will you ask? What insights and visions will they send back? Our second goal is to use the epistolary form to explore questions of genre, media, and craft. How is a letter different than, say, a text? What makes some letters more evocative than others? How does this kind of writing connect to the writing we do in the other parts of our lives? What can this form help us to say? And how do our letters represent us, our essential selves? The hope is that we can come to see the letter as a useful tool for expressing ourselves in new (or is it old?) ways.","Pinto,James",ENGLISH,221,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Correspondence Course,3,HU,,With permission of instructor.,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Creative Writing,"
We have to accept ourselves in order to write. Now none of us does that fully; few of us do it even halfway. Don’t wait for one hundred percent acceptance of yourself before you write, or even eight percent acceptance. Just write.
-- Natalie Goldberg, Wild Mind 

Writing is a compassionate act. We may write to share something deep within us—an experience of joy, a scene of beauty, a discovery, a strange or humorous tale, a warning, a loss—with someone else. Writing may also allow us a space of compassion towards ourselves. As Natalie Goldberg notes, developing a writing practice can put us on a journey towards accepting ourselves fully, in all our messiness and complexity. 
I believe that writing is a space of infinite possibility: a space of potential discovery, transformation, challenge, experimentation, and world-making. In this course, you will commit to the practice of writing. It is my hope that through close engagement with the process and techniques of writing, you will gain the tools and skills to not only become a better writer, but a more compassionate person towards yourself and others. 
We will write a great deal together in this course; we will engage in timed freewriting, journaling, writing experiments, workshopping, and revision. With the sharp eye of a writer, you will close-read a variety of poems and essays. You will practice offering feedback during our workshops that does not inadvertently shut down the work of your peers, but instead allows the writer to open the work to new visions and possibilities. Most importantly, you will develop the habits of writing practice. You will put your pens and pencils to paper (or put your fingers on a keyboard) and lose control, take risks, and make mistakes. At the end of the semester, you will emerge with a revised essay and a group of poems, and we will celebrate our writing (and ourselves!) with a final reading.

Creative Writing,"In this course we will read and write fiction and poetry. We will consider the arrangement of words and sentences as art. Words and letters were said to have been discovered by Thoth, the Egyptian god of Magic who, while reclining by the Nile, observed ibis birds in flight and saw in their shapes the shapes of sounds. From this experience he created writing, and with it, he created incantatory magic. When Isis struggled to resurrect her dismembered husband Osiris, it was Thoth who gave her a slip of papyrus that contained a magic word to bring the god back to life. Poetry and stories are dead marks that come back to life each time we read them. The goal of this course is to introduce you to contemporary craft practices in creative writing, and to connect those practices to other writing you are doing at the college level.

By reading in diverse forms—from young adult novel (Marie G. Lee’s Necessary Roughness) to graphic novel (Trung Le Nguyen’s The Magic Fish), spy novel (Chang-rae Lee’s Native Speaker) to historical novel (C Pam Zhang’s How Much of These Hills Are Gold), coming-of-age novella (Milton Murayama’s All I Asking For Is My Body) to fictionalized memoir (Carlos Bulosan’s America Is in the Heart)—we will ask how Asian American writers take advantage of and reinvent various fictional forms so as to interrogate issues such as language, immigration, gender and sexuality, political resistance, and family relationships that lie at the heart of Asian American histories. We’ll ask, also, how centering Asian American literary traditions and experiments can provide a solid foundation with regards to fictional forms in English. Although the course is not intended to be a comprehensive history of Asian American literature, readings will include earlier canonical authors (Sui Sin Far, John Okada) as well as emerging writers (Elaine Castillo, Anthony Veasna So).","Balachander,Surabhi",ENGLISH,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Constructing Asian American Stories,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to Short Story and Novel,"This course will serve as an introduction to horror fiction by engaging with the question of what makes monsters monstrous. We will examine the fine and oft-transgressed lines between the human body and the monstrous body, and consider what makes this transgression so frightening. In doing so, we will engage with the ways various identities have been rendered monstrous in fiction, such as those of racial and sexual minorities, women, and people with disabilities, and how horror fiction has the power to inspire fear towards downtrodden groups. We will ask ourselves: What defines the “normal” human body? What defines the monstrous? Is it possible (or even desirable, or socially responsible) to safeguard the human against the monstrous?","Puckett,Torre",ENGLISH,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Monstrous Bodies in Horror Fiction,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to Visual Culture,"How is culture expressed in visual images? This deceptively simple question is the frame for the course through which we will study issues of production, circulation, and reception in art and visual media. Because visual culture is a fluid term, we will cut across disciplinary boundaries and theoretical approaches to consider not merely the ideas and the reality depicted by images but, rather, how images work and what they do. Throughout, our focus will be on people, places, and groups who are and are not represented in visual images from the emergence of photography in the mid-nineteenth century to social media in the present day. Put differently, we will look at what it means to be documented and what meaning can – or, perhaps, should – be ascribed to the undocumented.","Hartley,Lucy",ENGLISH,232,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Documented/Undocumented,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Introduction to Reading Poetry,"In this course, we will discover, learn, and unlearn our personal and cultural mythologies about reading poetry, with a focus on reading historical and contemporary documentary poems. Students will focus specifically on documentary poems that stretch, preserve, or subvert notions of community and of ""selfhood."" We will ask questions to guide our reading, writing, and discussion, such as: Who gets to write (and hold) history? What makes something a ‘documentary poem’? What does the verb “document” entail – who gets to “document” a place? What qualifies as a “document”? How might the documentary erase or expand the borders of a material object? Of the body? Of the self? Students will study poets and writers like Mark Nowack, Claudia Rankine, Muriel Rukeyser, Langston Hughes, Solmaz Sharif, and Terence Hayes, to name a few. Inspired by poet Solmaz Sharif, we will also consider what it means to expand the historical archives of a place by paying attention to a “variety of languages […] each with their own music, their own relationship to power [...] ” Students should expect to complete weekly readings, as well as a series of literary analytic essays, throughout the semester.","Duan,Carlina",ENGLISH,240,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Documentary Poetry,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Introduction to American Literature,"To what extent does a focus on race offer us an encompassing view of modern America—in the novel or in history more broadly? We’ll be reading four celebrated novels of the last 35 years that together offer a variety of perspectives, both oblique and direct, on matters of race and racism, as well as on a host of related issues. In addition, each novel is formally innovative. What’s the relationship between artistic experimentation and social critique? What’s the difference between discussion of race in a novel and in a work of history or sociology?

We will do literary close readings of texts to think through many of the issues relating to the development of an African American literary tradition. What constitutes a tradition? Can there be more than one? Along with these questions, we will examine our own assumptions about this literature and the many ways in which these texts reflect the different experiences of African Americans intent on gaining a national voice in a slaveholding and racially polarized nation.","Boisseron,Benedicte M",ENGLISH,274,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,AAS 111 (CAAS 111).,,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to Twentieth-Century Literature,"Despite generations of critique, the national narrative of the US as a land of and for refugees is still frequently retold. However, the history and literature of the past century and a half tells a different story. Many different stories, in fact. The history of migration and immigration turns out to be an ongoing crisis of representation itself. This course will provide historical and sociological contexts for understanding the rise of mass immigration and the varied waves of political and cultural responses. If we approach 21st-century US refugee fiction as an ongoing crisis of narrative (how to tell the stories of individuals who adopt a new culture and language of consciousness), it emerges as a rich tradition of literary innovation, subtle social critique, and transracial alliance-building. ","Miller, Joshua L",ENGLISH,285,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - American Refugees: The Shifting Borders of US Fiction,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Themes in Language and Literature,"The rise of fascism in twentieth century Europe, alongside other forms of far-right dictatorships legitimated by mass populism and virulent nationalism, provoked a united global front to defeat it.

Topics in Language and Literature,"Poetry is indeed a little mysterious; just look at this handful of quotations that try to describe what it is, what it does: “Poetry is language at its most distilled and most powerful.” (Rita Dove) “Genuine poetry can communicate before it is understood.” (T.S. Eliot) “Like a piece of ice on a hot stove the poem must ride on its own melting.” (Robert Frost) “Poetry is an echo, asking a shadow to dance.” (Carl Sandburg) “The poet is the priest of the invisible.” (Wallace Stevens) “If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.” (Emily Dickinson) This introductory-level class will take on the mystery of poetry in such a way that will strive to make it more accessible by developing clear strategies for reading poems—with a special focus on the role that sound plays in how poems do what they do to us. (Consider rhyme and meter most obviously—but also other, less defined ways that the sounds of language help to shape meaning.) The reading strategies we practice will help you engage with poetry’s strangeness which, for many people, is easy to dismiss as illegible or unimportant. But poetry’s strangeness, of course, reflects important strangenesses in the world around us, strangenesses we can choose to explore or ignore. We’ll start our work with a pair of crucial assumptions about reading poems: 1. Poetry is not a code to crack, and 2. Poems can’t be made out to mean whatever you want them to mean. Our mode will be primarily interpretive, and indeed just what it means to interpret and just how to know when you’re doing it well and when you’re being sloppy about it will constantly be on our radar as we do this work. Simply put, our class will be devoted to the act of reading poems together, during every class meeting, in order to practice and explore as a group the endeavor of deep, careful reading.","Knuth, Aric David",ENGLISH,292,"Winter 2022, ",Section 006, - Poetry and Sound,2,HU,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Topics in Language and Literature,"You probably know what a sonnet is—at least generally speaking. (Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?) You’ve likely read a haiku or two (The old pond / a frog jumps in / the sound of water) and maybe heard a limerick that made you blush (I once had a friend in Nantucket…) But these poetic forms are just a few of many: We also have sestinas and villanelles, odes and aubades, elegies and ekphrastics, tankas and ghazals and prayers—oh my! This introductory level class—which fits perfectly with English 292.006: Poetry and Sound, but can be taken on its own as well—will introduce you to a number of poetic forms in order to engage the question: What does the form of a poem do for the meanings and messages it suggests? How might knowing about these forms help us be better readers of poetry? After a crash course on some big-picture principles about engaging poetry generally, we’ll move from class to class looking at poems grouped by form—a group of sonnets, a group of haikus, some sestinas, some villanelles… And while we won’t confine ourselves to reading these poems solely through the lens of form, form, as our organizing principle, will be the idea we keep coming back to in our conversations about how these poems do their work. ","Knuth, Aric David",ENGLISH,292,"Winter 2022, ",Section 007, - Poetry and Form,1,HU,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Great Works,"There is only one core text for this class, and that is Shakespeare’s play The Tragedy of Hamlet. Other texts, for example, Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, will be considered along the way, but our center of consideration and discussion remains Shakespeare’s monumental work for the theater. Seminar meetings will begin with close—very close—readings, and we will proceed very carefully, cautiously and analytically. Students will be encouraged to focus their attention not only on the language of the play, but also on the language’s malleability for stage interpretation and performance, most especially so as the complexity of the text moves through time, place, stage history and changing fashions of critical interpretation. Video screenings of specific productions of the play are an integral part of the semester’s work. Students should count on more or less one video screening per week, and these are scheduled to take place outside of our class meetings.

Introduction to Literary Studies,"In The Aesthetic Dimension (1978), Herbert Marcuse argues that “the critical function of art, its contribution to the struggle for liberation, resides in the aesthetic form” (8). While it is perhaps all too common to hear discussion about a work of art, literary art in particular, conducted in terms of either content or form, Marcuse suggests that cultural productions appear as works of art as such through “content having become form” itself (8, emphasis added). In the texts we will read this semester, a range of poets and novelists attempt to fashion aesthetic forms from the matter of lives marginalized by race, gender, sexuality, disability and other non-dominant American identities. By thinking critically about how we read such texts and how we derive interpretations from those reading practices, we learn that literary analysis of form can be “as valuable to understanding sociopolitical institutions as it is to reading literature” (Levine 2). Throughout this semester, we will develop a critical vocabulary that invigorates our exploration of reading and enriches our interpretive methods; we will test out an eclectic, not-intended-to-be-comprehensive set of theoretical approaches; and refine our skills of written argumentation in contexts that matter in the field of literary studies.","Kupetz, Joshua  ",ENGLISH,298,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002,,3,HU,,,,Prerequisite for the English major and English Honors Plan.,May not be repeated for credit.

Directed Study,"As a privilege for students who have displayed academic excellence and who can show appropriate preparation in courses previously taken, the Department of English offers course credit for independent study. Independent study provides an opportunity for highly motivated and capable students to pursue a rigorous course of study that is not accommodated elsewhere in the curriculum.

Independent study proposals require advance planning. Each must be developed in consultation with a full-time member of the English Department faculty who will serve as a faculty mentor for the project, and subsequently must be approved by the Undergraduate Chair of the Department. Interested students should begin consulting with their mentors during the semester before the proposed independent study in order to develop a feasible course. Only those proposing a carefully structured and intellectually viable course of study that is not already offered in the undergraduate curriculum should submit applications. Independent study requires that students design their own courses, create their own syllabi, and work closely with faculty mentors. Supervising professors must donate a great deal of time and effort, so students applying for independent study should be similarly committed to the project. Students must be in residence in order to undertake independent study projects. A three-credit independent study should involve at least one hour of student-faculty contact plus an additional eight hours of work per week. It is also possible to elect two or four credit hours with appropriate changes in workload.

Professors normally do not supervise independent studies during terms when they are on leave, nor do they supervise them on subjects which fall outside of their areas of specialization, or on subjects covered by regular course offerings. A limit of six credit hours of independent study may be accumulated in the English department. Independent study projects cannot be used to fulfill Department program requirements or College distribution requirements.
To apply:

Pick up an Independent Study Application at the English Department office at 3187 Angell Hall. 
Complete Part I of the independent study application and attach a statement addressing each of the questions posed there along with a copy of your transcript.
Part II of the application must be completed by the supervising faculty member. 
Submit both parts of this proposal to the Undergraduate Secretary in 3187 Angell Hall.

Topics in Literary Studies,"What accounts for the persistent popularity of characters like Alice in Wonderland, Br’er Rabbit, Cinderella, Peter Pan, and Harry Potter? In this class, we explore how popular stories for children engage with shifting ideas about children and childhood. We consider a range of works from the nineteenth century to the present, situating these stories within broader trends in British and American cultural history. What conceptions of childhood do these texts register and produce? How do these tales engage with social issues? How do they function as “mirrors” or “windows” for their child audiences? How do they follow or veer from philosopher John Locke’s assertion that children’s literature should provide “instruction with delight”? The readings and assignments for class will indeed delight you, as they encourage you to reflect on your own experiences as a child reader, to reevaluate books with which you may already be familiar, and to cultivate an awareness of our culture’s assumptions about childhood.","Makman,Lisa Hermine",ENGLISH,313,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Children's Literature and the Invention of Modern Childhood,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Topics in Literary Studies,"Scholars define a Catholic novel not by the beliefs or identity of its author but by how closely the mainspring of its dramatic action depends upon Roman Catholic ideas or theology. A significant literary achievement, the Catholic novel is primarily associated with a group of British and American authors who were writing in the mid-twentieth century while contemplating the horrors of modernity: two world wars, ethnic and religious genocides, the rise of totalitarian states, the false promises of consumerism and scientism, and the haunting sense of an ending – of a world that seemed to be expiring (not with a bang but a whimper). Catholic novels do not proselytize – they are written by artists not evangelists – but they do tell powerful stories about broken people exercising free will in a fallen world, about the mystery and silence of God, about incarnation and atonement, and about temptation, sin, and redemption. These works are about the meaning – and the difficulty – of life from a Catholic point of view. In this class, students will learn about Catholic thought and doctrine, the relationships between religion and culture, the “religious turn” in literary studies, and the lives and works of our four authors: Graham Greene, Flannery O’Connor, Muriel Spark, and Walker Percy.","Lyons,Scott Richard",ENGLISH,313,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - The Catholic Novel,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Topics in Literary Studies,"In times of tyranny and political turmoil, we often command ourselves not to give in to despair. The reasons for this directive would seem obvious: hope is a necessary condition for action and change, whereas despair leads to resignation and more of the same—or so the logic goes. But is this logic really that self-evident? How exactly did we come to believe that “action is impossible without hope” (as Rebecca Solnit has it)? Why is despair “not an option” (as the Bernie Sanders slogan says)?

Disability Studies,"Literary Disability Studies encourages us to consider the thematic, formal, and aesthetic functions of disability and neurodiversity in literary texts. Prised away from a mooring in biomedicine and pathology, disability appears as an identity, a vibrant way of life, and a critical site for the broader re-discovery of the “body” as critical lens and sensuous experience. By reading texts about, informed by, and structured in relation to disability, we can learn ways to explore non-normative embodiment and develop an awareness of how disability can change what we think about narrative, poetics, and aesthetics as such. We will discuss disability and neurodiversity histories and other textual artifacts that foreground non-normative embodiment and literary forms. Not least, we will analyze texts that help us develop an understanding of disability as a complex, vital part of human experience that informs our approaches to literature and imaginative texts more broadly.","Kupetz, Joshua  ",ENGLISH,316,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Literary Disability Studies,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Literature and Culture,"The inspiration for this course is Jordan Peele’s remarkable 2017 film, Get Out. When it was released, Peele announced that his film was part of a genre that he dubbed “the social thriller,” which he explained as “thriller/horror movies where the ultimate villain is society.” These films use suspense to explore and expose social inequity, especially around issues of class, race, gender, sexuality and empire. We will spend the first three-quarters of the term reckoning with Peele’s film and its literary and filmic ancestry. We’ll watch Get Out, Night of the Living Dead, The Stepford Wives, Rosemary’s Baby, and The Shining, defining as we go the social thriller and its neighbor genres (political thriller, horror, slasher, horror spoof). We’ll read some film history and theory to think about the grammar and technology of film, as well as the ways that films condition spectatorship (desire, identification, dis-identification) and deliberately withhold or provide information. Then we’ll delve into Get Out’s literary antecedents: Othello, Frankenstein, Poe’s “Fall of the House of Usher,” selections from Olaudah Equiano’s and Frederick Douglass’s slave narratives and, finally, Morrison’s Beloved. You’ll work up from small writing assignments (video commentary of a film scene, written film review, scene analysis, precis of criticism/theory) to a 10-12pp research paper (or lengthier research video), due 3 weeks before the term’s end. In the last two weeks of the term, we’ll explore some other examples of the genre that preceded Peele’s 2017 film.

Literature and Culture,"In the novel The Hakawati by Druze Lebanese author Rabih Alameddine, the narrator describes the grandfather figure and titular character as among a generation who “escaped to Lebanon during the great Armenian orphan migration” (84). Alameddine here refers to the genocide of Armenians, understood in Armenian Studies as a totality of violent events from 1915-1923 that so defines the Armenian diasporic experience. While the history of this forced migration has traditionally anchored approaches in Armenian Studies for the study of Armenian identity negotiation outside of a territorial Armenian homeland, scholars such as Khachig Tölölyan have demonstrated the limitations of the singular rubric “the Armenian Diaspora” when modern globalization is taken into account. Relatedly, scholars such as Sebouh David Aslanian have articulated that Armenian mobility transpired by other means before the removal of Armenians as part of the 1915 Catastrophe. Displacements during and after the Soviet Union and due to the humanitarian crisis in Artsakh provide additional avenues to conceptualize Armenian belonging. Taking cues from recent scholarship, this course turns to diverse media (literature, print culture, art, and song) to offer a relational approach for the study of Armenian diasporic experiences. Relational encompasses both time and space, which allows us to juxtapose migrations pre- and post-1915 as well as to situate different geopolitical sites of upheaval in conversation (Turkey, Armenia, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine). Ultimately, this course will appeal to students within and beyond Armenian Studies as it situates Armenian migrations and ensuing lived conditions within connective, regional, and global paradigms.","Makhdoumian,Helen",ENGLISH,317,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003," - Armenian Relationality: Diasporas Old, New, and in the Making",3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Genre Studies,"This course will romp through about 14 of the best plays from the seventeenth and eighteenth century. The earlier plays are the wittiest and bawdiest plays in the English language. Inaugurating the first appearances of actresses on the English stage, Restoration comedies are brilliant, satirical, and fierce in exploring issues of sexual desire, rivalry, and frustration.

Literature and Social Change,"Abolition literature is one of the most powerful examples of how literature fuels social change. In the midst of heated national debates about the political, economic, and social expediencies of slavery, activists used memoirs, novels, newspapers, and magazines to disseminate powerful arguments for the abolition of slavery. We’ll begin by considering the historical contexts of the slavery debate, then read classic texts such as The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, David Walker’s Appeal, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown’s Clotel, and Harriet Jacobs’ Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, as well as articles from leading anti and pro slavery newspapers and magazines.","Nichols,Dana",ENGLISH,319,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - The Literature of Abolition,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Instead, writing, like life, (as James Baldwin says) is a series of conundrums. Problems and questions, not solutions and answers.  Thinking about writing—and life—as not just questions but disasters helps emphasize this uncertainty and frees us from the expectation that our writing and our lives should be neat, pat, easily understood.

Images are imbedded with arguments about national identity and the social body. In this course we’ll begin by constructing a shared vocabulary for reading visual culture. We will then look at a few key historical moments when representations of racial and ethnic groups were actively shaped by cultural and national narratives about the fitness of the U.S. social body.","Nichols,Dana",ENGLISH,332,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Race and Visual Culture,3,"RE, HU",,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Studies in Poetry,"What does race have to do with poetry?  Wait – what do those terms even mean?  Why look at them together?  This mixed lecture and discussion-based course offers a variety of answers:  we’ll explore contemporary poetry and poetics (mostly written in the U.S.)  as arenas where people have grappled with notions of race, explored its history and effects, and worked to make social change and advance antiracist agendas.  Our semester will fall into four units:  First, we’ll get our bearings with our two key terms and develop a working vocabulary for the course by exploring how the meanings of “race” and of “poetry” have shifted from the eighteenth century to today.  Next, we’ll analyze several influential nineteenth and twentieth-century English and American treatises on poetry to explore ideas about race that lie at their center; these treatises will help us to understand how the idea that poetry is the most literary of “human” activity has contributed to racist (and classist!) hierarchies of who counts as human and less-than human.  We’ll then discuss how racial masquerade and minstrelsy in the U.S.--and critiques of these practices and their racist assumptions--have shaped poetry and poetics in the U.S. from the nineteenth century to the present.  During the second half of the course, we’ll read poems and other writing by contemporary poets in the U.S. that grapple with logics of race and identity; these works will allow us to see that the stereotype of poetry as divorced from real world issues and politics is a misunderstanding with a (racist) history.","White,Gillian Cahill",ENGLISH,340,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Poetry and Race,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Tolkien, and Alyssa Wong, we will investigate the cultural and psychological dimensions of fantastical narratives. We will also study common fantasy figures, forms, and tropes, such as the animal helper, the ghost, the portal, the labyrinth, and the voyage narrative. We will discover how they are reconfigured and granted new meanings in various works and contexts.

"Literature in English, 1660-1830","The idea of the ""self"" is one we take largely for granted: it's difficult to imagine that the ""selfhood"" we ascribe to ourselves and those around us might be somehow experienced or imagined differently. Scholars increasingly agree, however, that modern conceptions of the self--foregrounding individualism, autonomy, and self-determination--are a product of literary and philosophical developments of the past 400 years. This course will examine influential works of English and European literature from a critical period—the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--during which many of these changes took place, while also considering recent contributions from other disciplines that challenge some of our deepest resulting beliefs about what it means to be human.","Porter,David L",ENGLISH,351,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - The Modern Self and its Critics,4,HU,,,,W.,May not be repeated for credit.
The Victorian Novel,"Bigamy, broken engagements, suicide, war, love, marriage, adultery, illegitimate children, theft, murder, and death: this is the stuff of nineteenth-century novels. This course will examine the bestseller as a distinctively modern phenomenon, with origins in the nineteenth century and relevance to the creative industries today. The title, ‘Not the Victorian Novel,’ is deliberately provocative, both challenging the arbitrariness of a period determined by the life of a British monarch (Queen Victoria, 1837-1901) and cutting across distinctions between high and low, elite and popular, forms of literature. To this end, we will read some of the bestselling British novels of the nineteenth century and work out why they were so popular, what, if anything, they have in common, and whether they stand the test of time. Of especial importance will be the emergence of novel-writing as a profession – for women as well as men – in parallel with the rise of the bestseller as a creative industry – for profit. The aim in looking at the novel from these perspectives is, therefore, to understand how literature can generate economic as well as aesthetic value in society.","Hartley,Lucy",ENGLISH,361,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Bestsellers and the Creative Industries,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Readings in African American Literature,"In this course we will study African American literature written after the abolition of slavery (1865), covering African American history from the late nineteenth century period known as the ""nadir"" (lowest point), through the early 20th century moment that gave birth to the ""New Negro"" of the Harlem Renaissance (1920s). The writers from this period expressed both pessimism about post-Civil War racial violence in the US and optimism about African Americans' new opportunities for civic and cultural legitimacy.  Their novels, short stories, prose and poetry demonstrate that African American writers saw literature as critical to shaping ongoing national debates about freed people’s rights to citizenship.  We will explore  how black writers depicted differences within black communities through dialect, invocations of the “folk” and assertions of a ""new negro"" in their efforts to craft new political forms of racial identity at a time that was supposed to harbor great promise for ""freedmen"" (formerly enslaved individuals) and their descendants.  In our studies we will try to answer a key question:  How did African American writers respond to the rise of Jim Crow and the racial violence that established white supremacy in the South? And, more importantly, what do those responses from the past tell us about our racial justice/injustice in our present?","Santamarina,Xiomara A",ENGLISH,374,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Black Writers Respond: Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century African American Literature,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Topics in English Language and Literature,"The history of the “future” begins in the Middle Ages: the word enters the English language for the first time in a medieval romance. Although often caricatured as “happily ever after” stories, medieval romance—the pop culture and fan fiction of its day—is centrally concerned with uncertain futures, aka “adventures” (literally, experiences that are “about to come”). This is why medieval romance imagines otherworlds (such as an underworld fairy kingdom), technological gadgets (like a flying horse made of brass), and other marvels; it is why romance explores different forms of embodiment (a knight with green skin or one who is part demon; a woman who can change from old to young every night); and it is why medieval romance is an important resource for modern speculative fiction. Medieval romance asks a range of questions about the future: How can you make a promise when you don’t know what the future holds? Are you the same person when you travel between spaces and across time (including our ordinary progress through the future one day at a time)? When do experiences or events shape or even determine your future, and when is the future open to events that are entirely unanticipated? At the end of the semester, we will ask whether medieval literature has—or should have—a future, and what kind of future we think it could have.","Sanok,Catherine",ENGLISH,407,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - The Uncertain Future of Medieval Romance,3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Topics in English Language and Literature,"Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan Quartet has sold more than 10 million copies in 40 countries. Some have called it a Harry Potter saga for adults. But Ferrante does not build a fantastic universe of wizards, patronuses, and magical trains. On the contrary, the quartet’s portrayal of female friendship, motherhood, and family unfolds against the backdrop of a very distinct and underexplored Italian past. And yet despite being rooted in the particularities of Italian urban life, Ferrante’s saga has become a global phenomenon. What makes it so appealing to audiences all over the world? In this class, we will read all four of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels and discuss its peculiar place (and the place of Italy more broadly) in World Literature.

Topics in English Language and Literature,"Poems in praise of women’s nipples, satires about London whorehouses, pornography featuring lesbian sex and dildos:  forget what you thought you knew, this is how English Renaissance writers wrote about sex! Their attitudes toward sex were complex; their use of genre and literary form to express these attitudes were innovative and often brilliant. Many things that 21st century readers take for granted—that people tend to be straight or gay and that romance makes sex most fulfilling—did not concern them. Many of the things that might trouble us about their sexual relations—such as the subordination of women’s desire to that of men and the prerogative of male sexual violence—they took for granted. ","Traub - she-her, Valerie  ",ENGLISH,407,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003, - Renaissance Sex,3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Technology and the Humanities,"How were disabilities understood and mediated in past eras? How does the representation of disability in the English-speaking world reflect the priorities and aims of Anglo-American colonialism and empire? What kind of disability histories do we need today? This advanced undergrad/grad course is a collective investigation into the constructions of disability in textual, material, and visual culture from the Early Modern period to the late Twentieth Century, with an emphasis on 19th-Century US and British sources. The culmination of the semester’s discussions and research will be a student-curated online and in-person exhibit housed at the Clements Library. Major secondary texts will include Lennard Davis’s Enforcing Normalcy, Rosemarie Garland-Thompson’s Extraordinary Bodies and Kim Nielsen’s A Disability History of the United States. We will also read primary texts by William Wordsworth, Samuel Gridley Howe, Harriet Martineau, Lydia A. Smith, and Robert Langdon Down, among others. Along the way, participants will have the chance to speak with visiting disability historians, activists, literary critics, curators, archivists, and scholars in the Public Humanities and Museum Studies to learn more about the stakes and challenges of doing historical and curatorial work. Graduate student participants will take the lead on various divisions of the final project, and read, review, and present on a recent book in the field.","Orr,Ittai",ENGLISH,420,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Disabilities Past,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Advanced Fiction Writing,"This advanced fiction workshop invites students to share their writing and develop their skills in a collaborative environment. Beyond workshop, we will spend our time (perhaps more time than in your standard workshop) writing and discussing shorter creative pieces designed to explore the broader craft challenges that come with compelling storytelling. The basic idea here is that we get better at writing through practice and conversation and rigorous revision—and that a good story is usually not a lucky accident, but is the happy meeting of ecstatic expression and elevated technical control. At the end of the term, students will have written a portfolio of new, revised fiction.","Pinto,James",ENGLISH,423,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,With permission of instructor.,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

We’ll workshop our poems together, read and listen to books of poems weekly, and most of all, I hope, provide good company to each other.

Advanced Essay Writing,"In this class we'll read, talk, and--most importantly--write about our relationship with happiness.  We'll address a variety of questions on the subject, including perhaps: What do we even mean when we use the word ""happiness""? Is it an unhelpful abstraction? A selfish or socially irresponsible priority? Mere clickbait for TED talks? The absolute and best aspiration for our lives? How does our interaction with pop culture, modern technology, or the natural world affect (or effect) our contact with happiness? How do our conceptions of happiness overlap or diverge?

Modern Poetry,"In 1921, the American poet T.S. Eliot wrote, “Poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be difficult. Our civilization comprehends great variety and complexity, and this variety and complexity, playing upon a refined sensibility, must produce various and complex results.” Difficulty – what’s difficult to read and understand -- has, since Eliot wrote these words, become almost synonymous with the idea of modern poetry in the U.S. and Europe. But whose work of the period counted as difficult (and why?) and how has that shaped the way canons of Modern poetry have been written? Students in this course will explore the power and the limits of Eliot’s influential assessment, learning to read a range of poetry from the early to mid-twentieth century to understand but also question what Eliot and others meant by “difficulty” and why they valued it, which turns out to be not just a matter of aesthetics, but evidence that poetry was a fertile cultural ground on which played out some of the period’s major struggles over art in its relationship to social life, gender, class, and race. Students learn to think critically and historically about the categories “Modernism” and “modernity” by which writers and literary historians have sought to make sense of the period’s poetry, and the social and political upheavals that saw it come about. We will consider how issues of race, class, gender, nation, and citizenship shape and are shaped by the writing we read, and wrestle with the claims about form, language, and the world that these writers engaged.","White,Gillian Cahill",ENGLISH,440,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Modernist Poetries in the U.S.,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Studies in Poetry,"In the essay “Poetry is Not a Luxury,” Audre Lorde writes that “Poetry is the way we help give name to the nameless so it can be thought.” Poetry is often portrayed as a form of articulation in which thoughts and feelings can be given voice and find an audience—especially those thoughts and feelings that other forms of rhetoric, including daily speech, do not accommodate. From the intensely personal to the subversively political, poetry can therefore be a haven for ideas and emotions that hegemonic, patriarchal, capitalistic, racist, or otherwise prejudicial social frameworks frame as “unruly” or “inappropriate.” Unlike so many other forms of speech, poetic expression appears limitless in its capacity. But that appearance is also deceiving. Together, we’ll explore the following questions: What separates a revolutionary “unruly feeling” in a poem from a harmful one? What makes one poem seem like a courageous exploration while another reads as appropriative or otherwise problematic? Are there limits to what can be named and thought in a poem that differ from what can be named or thought elsewhere? The bulk of our reading will be poetry from the 20th century through to the present, and we will also read literary scholarship and theory that grapples with the question of what—if anything—is unique about poetic speech as well as the ethics of literary expression.","Chakraborty,Sumita",ENGLISH,442,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Unruly Feelings,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Modern Drama,"This seminar will examine the rise of an authentically American drama from the socially progressive and realistic theater of the 1920s and 1930s to the present.  Beginning with playwrights like Elmer Rice, Sophie Treadwell, Susan Glaspell and Clifford Odets, and continuing through the accomplishment of “the big four” (Eugene O’Neill, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee), class meetings will also consider the ways in which contemporary writers for the American stage engage in a sometimes uneasy dialogue with their famous predecessors in terms of race, class, gender, ethnicity and questions of sexual identity, ageism and difference.  Playwrights to be considered in our ongoing discussions include Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Lorraine Hansberry, Suzan-Lori Parks, Paula Vogel, Tony Kushner, David Henry Hwang, and August Wilson, as well as additional figures drawn from the theatrical here and now (Amy Herzog, Lynn Nottage, Samuel D. Hunter, Dominique Morissaeau, Annie Baker and John Robin Baitz, among others).  Students enrolled in this course will be asked to prepare and present bi-weekly reports to the class as a whole; there will be an in-class midterm exam as well as a final term project.  Class meetings will be supplemented by video recordings; these will be held on reserve at Asquith in the Shapiro Library for required outside-of-class viewing. ","Brater,Enoch",ENGLISH,447,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - 100 Years of American Drama,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Literature,"Across England in 1381, workers came together to demand more respect and better working conditions. It was a forceful, impressive, and coordinated uprising that made an impression on many of the era’s writers.

But what exactly is plot, anyway? What is its appeal for us as readers, and how did it get such a bad reputation? What makes a plot seem more or less successful?

English Romantic Literature,"What we now call Romanticism—that brief explosion of literary, cultural, and political change that began with the French Revolution in 1789 and ended in the 1820s—may well constitute the most momentous period in British literary history. A wide range of political movements arguably find their genesis in these tumultuous decades, including radicalism, abolitionism, and environmentalism. Many familiar ideas about literature and the arts emerged during this time as well, as did many of the frameworks through which we understand our own possibilities for social change. In this course we’ll study the literature of the Romantic period and explore the relation between its political dreams and its poetic innovations. We’ll be particularly interested in how writers respond to the failure of the French Revolution and develop different formal and rhetorical strategies with which to re-imagine or critique its unfulfilled promises of liberté, égalité, and fraternité, especially considering the persistence of slavery, patriarchy, and class-based inequality. We’ll also be interested in how works that appear to have little to do with politics nevertheless register discontent with things as they are and a desire for things to be otherwise. While our primary readings will be drawn from the Romantic period, the course will define Romanticism as a poetics that continues to be relevant in the contemporary world. Accordingly, students will be asked to make connections between these readings and more recent literary and cultural texts.","Schey,Taylor",ENGLISH,461,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Romantic Poetry,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Milton,"Milton’s life and career confound our latter-day theories of separate realms:   he was at once an ivory tower intellectual and a practical servant to a government that had violently broken with centuries of monarchical rule, a poet of empire and an anti-imperialist.  His prose tracts make the case for regicide and revolution, for radical reform in religion, governance, and relations between the sexes, but he was also a consummate spokesman for unreconstructed patriarchy.  Reading broadly in the major poems (especially Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes) and selected prose, we will try to understand how this poet and his era--the complex social, political, and religious unfolding of the English Reformation--transformed the written word. ","Gregerson,Linda K",ENGLISH,469,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - World Breaking Apart: The Poetry of John Milton,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Colonial and Revolutionary American Literature,"In 1776, people living in the vast region west of the Allegheny Mountains, including Michigan, had little reason to think the colonial insurrection on the East Coast affected them. Yet many would wake up one day to find that they live in the new United States of America. What did they think of this “empire of liberty,” as Thomas Jefferson called it? What was America to border-crossers and people crossed by US borders in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries? This course views the advancing US borders through the literature of the margins: from memoirs of removal at the hands of settlers from Pennsylvania and Ohio to the poetry of Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, the first Native American to write in English, to Mari´a Ruiz de Burton, who watched her home in California become part of the United States. Along the way, we will read works by familiar American authors like Washington Irving and James Fennimore Cooper in a new light, unearthing the anxieties and uncertainties of unstable boundaries, and the latent possibilities for coexistence they evoke. Assignments include a close analysis of a map, an argument based on the circulation and reception of a text, and a comparative analysis of two texts separated by time.","Orr,Ittai",ENGLISH,470,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Frontiers and Borderlands,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

The atmosphere is a resource and, as with any critical resource, its use needs to be managed to preserve its quality.

Sources emitting a wide range of potential pollutants are being built and retrofitted every year creating a demand to assess their potential impact on nearby (and even far-away) communities. 

Sadly, the need to understand and predict the transport and dispersion of pollutants has taken on an even greater importance in recent years with the growing possibility that bio- and nuclear-terrorist events threaten large populations. This chilling possibility demands the creation of rapid-response warning systems based on our understanding of atmospheric motions.","Keppel-Aleks,Gretchen",ENSCEN,463,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,BS,,,Math 215.,,May not be repeated for credit.

Science and Sustainable Development,"One of the biggest challenges facing our society today is that growth and prosperity come with a huge environmental cost. Is there an alternative way to thrive? The United Nations thinks so, and in 2015, they created “a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.” The result led to 17 sustainable development goals “which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.” This course will explore 7 of these goals through the lens of a scientist. We will explore the science behind what we know and how we know it. Then we will explore how cutting-edge science being done today might offer solutions for the future.","McNeil, Anne  ",ENVIRON,109,"Winter 2022, ",Section 100,,3,NS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

"Energy and Climate Change: Technology, Markets, and Policy","
Energy is an incredibly complex topic by virtue of the inter-linkages of science, technology, public policy, economics, and human behaviors. This course will examine all aspects of energy: supply and demand, technical and social, with a concerted look at the natural place of social science (behavior, pricing, externalities, social norms) in the energy sphere. 

Every aspect of present-day society depends on the continuing availability of clean, affordable, flexible, secure, and safe energy resources. Yet nearly 90% of our current energy needs are met by fossil fuels. Our reliance on fossil fuels has led to declining supplies, rising prices, global climate change, and security concerns. The current global energy economy is not sustainable. The technological challenges are formidable; but they cannot be considered solutions without considering the human and social behavioral side of energy demand. 

The quest for solutions to ""The Energy Problem"" is dominated by technology ""fixes"". The visions of practical technological fixes, whether electricity energy generation, oil exploration and extraction, pollution mitigation, automobile fuel efficiency and alternatives to combustion engines, etc., necessarily build on what we know today and presume that we can achieve in a couple of decades or so, through sufficient R&D, an energy supply-demand balance that fulfills a wide range of incompatible requirements —  cheap, environmentally benign, politically secure, unconstrained supply, convenient, and safe. While we expect technology to come to our energy-rescue and support our established patterns of economic growth and energy-intensive lifestyles, we tend to expect very little from the human and social behavioral side of energy use and demand. In some ways the Energy Problem is yet another version of C.P. Snow's Two Cultures — parallel technology and social cultures with little mutual understanding and rare cross-over exchange. 

 The Complex Systems view would hold that society and Energy technologies have coevolved through the actions of individual agents (inventors, scientists, entrepreneurs, financiers, writers, politicians, kings and queens, dictators, and statesman), learning, adapting, selecting, exchanging information, and interacting through transactions of many kinds. At every stage, the social, economic, and technological systems were tightly coupled. It is not possible to understand Energy Problems without framing them in a systems context.Course Requirements:Two midterm exams, a Final Exam, graded homework assignments, and a term project.Intended Audience:Freshmen and Sophomores interested in energy and complex systems.

Topics in Culture and Environment,"Jeju Island, Korea, is said to have three abundances: rocks, wind, and women. Rocks, the geological wonders of the volcanic island, are now codified into a number of national and UNESCO park lands that foster stunning biodiversity. The winds that have made life harsh on Jeju are being harnessed for energy, as the island aims to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Women, particularly the free-diving fisherwomen known as haenyeo (sea women), typify Jeju’s distinct island culture and community spirit. Jeju’s idiosyncratic charm forms much of its international appeal, but is the commodification of Jeju helping to preserve its environment and culture, or simply packaging them for palatable consumption? This course examines the geology and biodiversity of Jeju in conjunction with its culture, politics, and history to form an understanding of this beautiful and beguiling island’s place in the modern world.","Walsh,Rory",ENVIRON,304,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002," - Rocks, Wind, Women",3,HU,Sustain,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

The Built Environment: Introduction to Landscape Change,"
 

This course provides a forum for the critical examination of  
human-built spaces and their relationship to the natural environment.   

It facilitates an inquiry around two basic sets of questions:

For any given site, what are its features, functions, and history; how does it act on its natural surroundings, and with what natural constraints?

At a broader level, how do we understand the boundary between the ""built"" and ""natural""; in what ways does this line blur, and how have these meanings changed over time?

Over the course of the academic term, students will develop a conceptual vocabulary for tackling these questions — a language for examining and expressing with precision and subtlety what is happening in our built environment.  Ultimately, students should gain a richer understanding of the term ""environment"" itself.

We will take a multi-faceted approach to this work.Course Requirements:The core work of the course is students' reading, reflecting, and sharing their insights in a variety of formats. Students are expected to:


 engage in class discussion in an informed and thoughtful way; 
write five brief essays (about 2 pages each) reflecting on a particular day's assigned reading; 
edit, revise, and expand the short essays into a single 10- to 12-page final paper; 
make a 10-minute oral presentation to the class on a site of the student's choosing (some students will substitute a paper for this assignment); 
prepare an illustrated analysis of a built environment on campus, using photos and/or drawings and short passages of text.
Intended Audience:Sophomores and Juniors in the Program in the Environment, or elsewhere in LSA. The course should appeal both to students interested in environmental literacy generally, and to those following specific environmental career tracks.Class Format:Class sessions will include lively discussion, small-group exercises, student presentations, and brief lectures.","D'Anieri,Philip James",ENVIRON,350,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, ID",Sustain,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Chinese Food in Crisis: Health, Ecology, and Identity in an Age of Globalization","The current Chinese diet is nothing like it was fifty years ago. Today, Western influence makes itself felt in the diets of a billion Chinese– evinced by the ubiquity of fast food chains like KFC in urban malls, the milk cartons and sugary drinks downed by school-age children, and pork and beef manufactured through industrial systems of food production. Critics charge that the Westernization of the Chinese diet has contributed to expanding waistlines, skyrocketing rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Experts also blame Westernized cuisine and food production for the destruction of the Chinese environment and the countryside. Food critics blast Westernization for the erosion of a venerable Chinese culinary tradition. But is any of this true? This course will evaluate the impact of dietary Westernization from an interdisciplinary perspective, considering its implications for health, environment, and national identity.

The Psychology of Environmental Stewardship,"One enduring challenge of living sustainably on a finite planet is to craft a future in which we will all want to live. A materialistically simpler existence may soon be an ecological necessity. However, it is unlikely to be adopted by many people if it is promoted in the wrong way, as a form of sacrifice requiring compensation, rather than as a choice that is personally meaningful while also being good for the planet. The challenge becomes, then, how to promote sustainable living so that people accept and even embrace it.","De Young,Raymond K",ENVIRON,361,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,Sustain,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Environmental Activism: Citizenship in a Republic,"



There is a rich history of American environmental activism that accelerated in the 1960's and became widespread in the 1970's, spurred by an increasing awareness of the harmful effects of pollution on public health and the destructive effect of industrial activity on the planet.  The Santa Barbara oil spill off the coast of California and the widely-disseminated photos of the Cuyahoga River on fire near downtown Cleveland, Ohio had a profound effect on the American public. These jarring events and others led to an unprecedented wave of environmental lawmaking, spurred, in part, by the actions of the public.  At this time in our environmental policy-making and regulations, when so much seems dire, this course may offer a more pragmatic perspective on the battles of environmentalism. 

Environmental Activism will provide an understanding of the history of environmental activism in the United States, the social and cultural context of the environmental movement, and the tools for effective environmental activism.  Students will be exposed to a range of advocacy tools that have shaped the movement, as well as the organizations and individuals who have been leading proponents of meaningful environmental change.  Students will actively participate in the discussion of assigned readings and current environmental challenges and complete independent writing assignments, as well as an end-of-semester project that builds on the themes of the course and advocates on behalf of an issue or perspective using the tools identified throughout the semester.","Murphy,Virginia E",ENVIRON,390,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,It is best to have at least one environmental course prior to this class.,,May not be repeated for credit.

Topics in Culture and Environment,"Nature is no outside of ourselves; we are Nature. Culture is a mirror of who we are as a species, a society, a community; it is a barometer of health, an evolving canvas for life. Landscape is a human conception, constructed of our goals and aspirations, built from necessity, avarice, invention and imagination. This course will examine layers of the nature/human relationship; how conceptualizations of “the outside” impact ways we continue to shape the planet and be shaped by it intentionally and by default, and how art can play a role towards environmental conservation. These roles can range from increasing the set of skills of environmental professionals to improving performance and communication, ultimately to be able to shape human behavior towards sustainable practices.","Adlerstein-Gonzalez,Sara",ENVIRON,464,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Nature, Culture, and Landscape",3,,,,At least one environmentally related course prior to this class.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

French and Francophone Literature and Culture,"Nineteenth-century French writers and artists were fascinated by the image of Spain — as a setting for their works, a destination for their travels, and a subject for creative invention.  A space of the exotic, of the mixing of cultures and religions (Muslims, Jews, and Christians), of  “primitive” values of honor, hospitality, and justice, of mystery and otherness, the representation of Spain played a major role in French writers’ explorations of new forms of art, social relations (gender, race, religion), and political structures.  In this class, we will explore the cultural meaning with which the idea of “Spain” was endowed in the French national imaginary and the historical, political, and aesthetic implications of this.  We will examine the manifestations and implications of this theme in selected texts by Chateaubriand, Gautier, Nodier, Hugo, Balzac, and Mérimée, as well as in one of the most popular and oft-performed French operas ever written — Bizet’s Carmen.","Hannoosh,Michele A",FRENCH,270,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - L'Espagne romantique,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

In this course, we will pursue the Grail across the centuries, from the first references in medieval tales of King Arthur and his knights, to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and the comedy/fantasy web series Kaamelott. The quest will take us around the world, from medieval France to contemporary America. We will analyze the Grail as a symbol that constantly transforms, as an object of desire that is (almost) always out of reach, and as a marker of moral purity. We will study a range of modern medievalisms, and critique white supremacist and colonialist ideas that draw on fictions of an idealized Middle Ages. A variety of sources will be examined, including literature, film, and visual art.

How have definitions of blackness, race, and belonging changed or remained the same throughout France’s political history?

Special Topics in French and Francophone Studies,"We love fiction and we hate lies. We admire artists whose flights of fancy push the boundaries of our own minds to the outer limits of the possible and feel nothing but contempt toward those who seek to deceive us. What explains the difference? In a world where the virtual gets to occupy an ever-larger share of our once material lives and where those who supposedly “tell it like it is” seem to have lost contact with the truth, it has become clear that what doesn’t exist does. In this course, we’ll enjoy our love of fiction but also probe our ambiguous feelings toward the false, the envisioned, and the merely unprecedented. We will look at various modes of falsehood and invention, from lies and deceptions to vision and creativity, and ask ourselves to what extent taking liberties with the truth may actually liberate us. We will not, however, approach these questions from a moral standpoint—who and what is right or wrong—but, keeping in mind the meanings of the verb “fabricate,” think about what things that seem unreal do and how they do it: in other words, what we’re actually making when we’re making something up.","Caron,David",FRENCH,350,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Making S*** Up,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

Caribbean Studies,"This course will focus on ideas of escape and fugitivity in order to examine the ways in which Caribbean writers, artists, and intellectuals have conceptualized freedom through flight. From marronage in the eighteenth century to exile in our contemporary moment, from Negritude to surrealism to spiralism, people in the Caribbean have broken colonial laws and literary and aesthetic rules in order to create new spaces for freedom and new possibilities for being. Our goal in this course is to understand the varied forms that this freedom has taken, and how it is articulated through different modes of flight.","Joseph-Gabriel,Annette",FRENCH,363,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Flight,3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.  
Problems in Society and Social Theory,"If anything, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of care in the proper functioning of the world. Who needs care? Who can provide it? Who has access to it and who doesn’t? Answers to these questions can map out a society’s shortcomings and vulnerabilities and raise complex questions: How can we think of care work as morally virtuous and socially essential yet so drastically underpay it? Does this have anything to do with the historical association of care work with women and people of color? Can a society value care and at the same time produce the very vulnerabilities that require it? If care remains entangled with racism, sexism, and other forms of social exclusions, can we also reclaim it as a resistant political practice? Can care serve as a model for ethical relations with others in general? At a more abstract level, what does it actually mean to care about someone or something?

"Contemporary France: Politics, Culture, and Society","Race is a social construct. In this course, students will be asked to go beyond this accurate, yet inadequate statement to ask precisely how, why, and by whom race was/is socially constructed. Focusing primarily on French imperial and ‘post’-imperial contexts, we will attend to how race intersects with other social categories such as class, gender, sexuality, and religion within an overarching logic of coloniality to produce and maintain the unequal hierarchies that underpin labor exploitation and land and resource expropriation at local, national, and international levels. In doing so, this course will introduce students to a range of writing on race and coloniality, from Critical Race Theory and Critical Muslim Studies to postcolonial studies and decolonial thought to help us collectively envision antiracist and decolonial futures.","Bharat, Adi Saleem  ",FRENCH,385,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Race, Religion, and Coloniality",3,"RE, HU",,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Readings in French and Francophone Studies (in English Translation),"This course seeks to familiarize students with the complex and multifaceted tradition of Marxist theory and practice while also tracing Marxism’s role in some of today’s most vibrant political movements. Our comparative approach will consider classical texts like The Communist Manifesto and State and Revolution alongside lesser-known but no less important works by Latin American and Caribbean writers and intellectuals. Instead of working toward a single definition of Marxism, we will explore the history of heterodox experimentation with the tradition’s most basic categories, always mindful of the continuities and discontinuities between different “Marxisms.” This necessarily interdisciplinary course will incorporate readings and discussions that span philosophy, literature, history, and politics. Special focus will be directed at Marxist analyses that attend to (and also sometimes fail to attend to) the interpenetration of class, race, and gender. Key figures for the course include: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, V. I. Lenin, Clara Zetkin, Mao Tse-Tung, Louis Althusser, Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, José Carlos Mariátegui, José María Arguedas, Álvaro García Linera, Raquel Guttiérez, Subcomandante Marcos, and Silvia Federici.","Arnall,Gavin",FRENCH,444,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Comparative Marxism,3,,,,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.

First-Year Film Seminar,"In 1972, cultural critic John Berger’s pivotal BBC television series and book Ways of Seeing opened by declaring that “seeing comes before words.” Berger wanted to explain the ways that both art and, in a more innovative approach for that time, commonplace images like advertising surround us every day. This course takes Berger’s insistence on the importance of images and updates it by examining both how images circulate online and what sorts of images are generated for and on the Internet. We will look at YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, livestreams and streaming platforms, as well as other forms of social media, memes, emoji and the use of icons in digital communication, fan and user-generated media, and more. Students will develop the ability to critically assess and analyze these media formally, learn about how culture is visual, and develop an understanding of the histories, industries, and cultures that images circulate in and help to shape. This class will have a seminar format that combines lecture and discussion as we learn to carefully examine and understand the visual culture of contemporary, everyday, digitally mediated life. Across many digital platforms today, we are invited to contribute images, annotate or adjust them, like or comment upon them, and position ourselves through our relationship to them.

Movie/Serial Television Production I,"This course prepares you for a lifetime of sustainable creative work in Movies and TV. Movies and TV are made by crews working collaboratively across Writing, the seven production departments (Producing, Production Design, Directing, Directing Photography, Lighting, Camera Operation & Sound) plus Editing. If you want a career in the movies or TV, you need to know these departments, what they do, and how they collaborate. This course starts you on that path through collaboratively producing movies/TV teasers both in-class and out of class. You will work in a team in at least 2 production departments as well as Editing and possibly Writing. Out of class, you will make, with your team, two short Movies/TV teasers. In class, you will also make shorter scenes with lots of hands-on assistance learning how the set works and how everyone’s contribution adds to the project. This experience will teach you how movies and TV are actually made—what the decision processes are; what each department contributes; how the vision of the program is determined and implemented; how to manage the logistics of production, production equipment, and personnel; how to effectively work with actors; and the completion process of the program for the audience. Skills and experience in any one area are valuable, but understanding the collaborative and integrated nature of how an idea makes it to the screen is necessary for success in the realm of TV and Movies. FTVM 400, TV Pilots and 423 take you further—competence and excellence come only with making media, learning from your successes and mistakes, and putting what you have learned to the test in your next, higher level, production.","Rayher,Robert W",FTVM,300,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

New Media History,"This class is a history of the digital. Today’s “new media” are cultural technologies of extraordinary complexity with a much longer history than we might first imagine. While first acknowledging that all media were once new, this class goes on to explore in-depth a more recent period in this very long history – the rise of what is often referred to as “digital media.” Computers, software, networks and the innovative sociocultural, economic, and artistic exchanges that occur through them have emerged from and actively remediated prior forms like radio, film, and television. At the same time, digital cultures have also introduced and spread new kinds of content and experiences. The affordances of digital life feel ubiquitous today, but has it always been that way? We will consider the historical development of computers, the Internet, and the many social, political, and industrial implications these contemporary technologies of entertainment and communication open up. Familiarizing yourself with this history will allow you to better understand current issues facing you today as a new media user and producer, and to integrate this knowledge into your academic studies, career aspirations, creative production, social life, and everyday existence.","Murray, Sarah  ",FTVM,354,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,FTVM 150 or FTVM (SAC) 236.,,May not be repeated for credit.

"Topics in Film, Television and Popular Culture","This course offers a critical introduction to filmmakers from the global south. We will analyze each filmmaker’s narrative and stylistic choices while situating their work in a larger historical and industrial context. We will study a rich and generically diverse body of cinema emanating from non-western contexts, including diasporic works. In doing so, we will trace the specific strategies of film style and narration that defined each filmmaker’s approach to cinema and how it affected the local and global audiences. With auteur theory as our starting point, we will examine how these filmmakers compel us to rethink the definition of film canons and authorship. This class will pay close attention to the politics of admission, who gets to be part of the hallowed halls of fame, and how selection rationales present a politics of exclusion that canonizes some works as art while marginalizing others. More importantly, filmmaking being a collective endeavor, how do we understand a model that reduces the effort to a singular vision, that of the director. We will also be attentive to the complexity of applying a western film theory to frame the work of filmmakers outside of western industrial and socio-political contexts. Some filmmakers we will study in this class include Meera Nair, Jafar Panahi, Ann Hui, and Lucretia Martel.","Rai,Swapnil",FTVM,366,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004," - Who Gets to Be an Auteur?: Ideology, Gendered Politics, and Filmmakers from the Global South",3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Using feedback from fellow students and the instructor, students will then devise a new game plan (in the form of a detailed outline) for their second drafts and then execute it by meeting a series of writing deadlines. Equipped with an understanding that rewriting does not end with a second draft, students will receive detailed notes from the instructor to write their third drafts and beyond.

Practicum for the Screenwriter,"423 brings together advanced screenwriting and production students from FTVM, actors from Theatre and Drama/Musical Theatre, and students with special design, sound, composing, and producing skills from other Schools and Colleges across the University to produce two  30-minute newly written stand-alone scripts based on feature screenplays from Screenwriting III . The goal of the course is to provide the screenwriters, the actors, and the production crew with the most integrated production environment possible, with lots of interaction between these three different domains. The writers re-write based on feedback from the actors, production crew and table readings of the scripts. The production crew works closely with the writer and actors to produce the 30-minute shorts. Students pitch for positions on the productions in late November or early December. The course starts by workshopping advanced drafts of the two scripts and the writers perfect them over the first few weeks. During this process, the production teams develop an in-depth production design based on an intimate knowledge of the script. Working with the actors the script will be rehearsed, and the production design, directorial, cinematographic, and acting approaches will be revised and developed as necessary to convey the full meaning of the script to the screen. As the scenes are shot the editors present rough cuts and the short is finished in time for a showing at Lightworks in April.","Burnstein,James S",FTVM,423,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,With permission of instructor.,"FMTV 290, 310, and 410.",,May not be repeated for credit.

National Screens,"This course examines films of three representative South Korean directors, Bong Joon-ho, Kim Ki-young, and Park Chan-wook, over the span of five decades. Some scholars call their films cult films. Others use “Asian extreme cinema,” a suspicious term saturated with Euro-American centrism, to refer to these directors’ non-normative narratives and styles. Regardless of these different nomenclatures, Bong, Kim, and Park are now regarded as the most important South Korean directors. One of the themes that bind these three directors together is transgression or deviation. Indeed, films of these directors explicitly challenge the social norms and tackle such issues as class division, gender inequality, inequitable society, and heteropatriarchy. Though it is impossible to view and analyze all their works, this course aims to follow their trajectory of filmmaking from their early works to their most recent work or swan song. By studying and comparing the works of these representative filmmakers intensively, this course also examines how these directors communicate with one another through styles, techniques, and artistic visions. Along with films by the three directors, students will also view Korean films of transgression made by women directors. Throughout the semester, we will also seek to answer the following questions: “what makes a great director?”, “who grants and recognizes the canonical status of films?”, “why aren’t there more representative women directors?”, and “can we decolonize Western-centrism in film studies by studying cinemas of small nations?”","Kim,Ungsan",FTVM,441,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Korean Directors of Transgression: Bong Joon-ho, Kim Ki-young, and Park Chan-wook",3,,,,FTVM 150 or FTVM (SAC) 236.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

As this is a course cross-listed between American Cultures and Film, Television, and Media, we will study both U.S. immigration law and the feelings and stories produced out of those laws. The films we’ll study will grapple with some of the following questions: what does it mean to become “American”? Who gets to aspire to citizen status? How have the technologies and discourses of race, gender, sexuality, and ability shaped the idea of the model citizen? What are the different ways im/migrant labor is codified, categorized, and capitalized upon? How does the idea of the United States as a “nation of immigrants” operate in tension with histories of indigenous genocide and chattel slavery?

This will shed light on the behind-the-scenes, non-glamorous elements of movie-making as a craft and as a commercial art form in the context of a global industry. We will look at many of the different people and organizations that make Hollywood function, including unions and guilds, producers, talent agents, marketing and advertising agencies, lobbyists, and lawyers, to name a few. Films screened for the class will include narrative fiction films about the industry, “behind the scenes” documentaries, as well as films that exemplify a particular week’s concept, from product placement to the powers of the MPAA. All films will be viewed critically and not as simple reflections, as Hollywood’s imagination of itself often diverges sharply from reality.

Concurrently, do these narratives about women privilege one type of woman over another? More importantly, how do we understand and interrogate these questions within non-western and global contexts? This course will delve into the multiple subjectivities, socio-cultural geographies, media practices and political activism that is folded into the category called ‘women’s cinema’. Beginning with an exploration of the 1970s “cine-feminism” that focused on women’s filmmaking and political activism, we will expand our discussion to transnational contexts and explore how feminist politics advocated by female and male filmmakers influence an understanding of women-oriented issues, forms, and values in circulation. We will examine women’s films produced within national and transnational geo-cultural spaces posing questions about national versus exilic or postcolonial auteur subjectivities. In doing so we will analyze the films’ aesthetics, institutional context of production, global circulation and situate them within the larger theoretical framework of feminist film theory, female vs. male authorship, postcolonial studies and transnational feminist scholarship.

Topics in Film Studies,"This class explores the often-outrageous genre of cult films and the plethora of marginal cinematic phenomena that it suggests – exploitation films, trash cinema, B-movies, and camp appropriation (fanzines and midnight audiences). Cult cinema connotes not only Japanese Godzilla films of the 1950s and beach-party musicals of the 1960s, but also offbeat art films like Paris, Texas as well as revisionist Thai Westerns and educational hygiene films. Owing to this heterogeneity, cult films are predictably objects of both patronizing ridicule and canonizing adulation, depending on one's tastes and conceptual frames of reference.","Kligerman,Mark William",FTVM,455,"Winter 2022, ",Section 005," - Cult, Camp, Art, and Exploitation",3,,,,FTVM 150 or FTVM (SAC) 236.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Intensive Elementary Course,"Intensive German I covers the first year of German language study in one semester. The goal of this course is to provide students with a basic but solid knowledge of grammatical structures and syntax, a functional vocabulary, familiarity with intonation patterns and native pronunciation, and practice in speaking and writing. At the end of German Intensive I, students can understand authentic and literary texts appropriate to the level and short spoken passages without glossed vocabulary, they can write an essay or short story without the aid of a dictionary, and they can converse on a range of general topics. This course, like all RC German language courses, is conducted in German, so students quickly become accustomed to using German for daily activities. Students in RC Lang 191 have many opportunities to gain facility with the language by speaking with more advanced learners and teachers in the program in informal settings, such as RC German lunch tables and coffee hours. In addition, they are introduced to web activities and films to help them explore aspects of German language and culture. In the Winter semester, the course is geared to students who have little or no prior exposure to the language.","Cribari-Assali,Carla",GERMAN,100,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,8,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Second-Year Course," “You are what you eat”—this commonplace coined by French gastronome Brillat-Savarin expresses in the form of an aphorism the myriad roles that food and drink, their production, preparation and consumption, play in our lives. Food and drink are often markers of national culture, as well as individual identity; they trigger memory and storytelling; they encapsulate the course of history; they reveal gender dynamics; they become environmental threats. Who cooks, who eats and drinks, what, when, and how much is consumed, what is acceptable, desirable or, on the contrary, disgusting tells us about cultural taboos, social status, gender roles, economic prosperity or lack thereof, ethnic and racial relationships, environmental awareness, and politics. We are, indeed, what we eat.

Second-Year Course,"Germany was divided for a total of 40 years between 1949 and 1989. Besides the opposing political systems, different art, film and literary movements emerged in the FRG and the GDR during this time. The division still plays a central role in the lives and cultural identity of many people in Germany. Therefore, it is not very surprising that life in the two ""Germanys"" is still present in modern media today, when one thinks of films such as Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others) or the mini-series Ku’damm 56. In this course, we will study films and texts that were created in the GDR during the Cold War era. These include texts by authors such as Christa Wolf and Jurek Becker, as well as DEFA classics like Die Legende von Paul and Paula. We will also look at modern works that depict life in the GDR from a contemporary point of view, such as the series Deutschland 83. In examining these texts and films in their cultural context, we will also think about how and why they continue to be relevant in contemporary Germany, and how they may be relevant in our own cultural context(s).

Second-Year Course,"On May 25th, 2020, a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck and back for more than nine minutes. Passerby’s video footage of the murder and Floyd’s words “I can’t breathe” sparked horror and cries of dismay across the US and the world. In the middle of the pandemic, which was already highlighting societal inequalities by disproportionately affecting those who are most vulnerable, Floyd's words became a trigger for a powerful movement mobilizing tens of thousands of people condemning racism and police brutality. Black Lives Matter slogans flooded our streets, social media and several news channels. This powerful movement resonated in Europe as it did, not only because of sympathy with Americans involved, but also because of recognition that there are similar issues in Europe as well. In many ways BLM protests against systemic racism in Europe echoed the ongoing debates over issues of migration and refugees in Europe, as well as the discrimination of Black Europeans, Europeans of Color, all marginalized groups and vulnerable communities.","Karuc,Ozlem",GERMAN,232,"Winter 2022, ",Section 007, - Being Black in Germany: 1933-today,4,,Lang Req,,GERMAN 221 or 231; or assignment by placement test.,"All sections of GERMAN 232 address special topics, e.g., music, philosophy, science, current political issues, etc.  F, W, Sp, Su.",May not be repeated for credit.

Topics in German Culture and the Arts,"

Nature and the environment feature prominently in the philosophy and cultural traditions of the German-speaking world—from the deification of nature within Romantic poetry and painting, through the blood-and-soil ideology of the Nazis, to the land art of Joseph Beuys and Hans Haacke during the Cold War. Today, German, Austrian, and Swiss people are considered some of the world’s most environmentally conscious, a fact reflected in the extent to which environmental issues currently shape the political agendas of their respective countries. 
While it may sound like it should belong exclusively to political or scientific activity, ecocriticism is environmentally focused criticism practiced by producers of literature, film, art, and theory. American films like the Mad Max Trilogy, The Day After Tomorrow, or Pixar’s WALL-E are popular earlier examples of the post-apocalyptic genre that has exploded in the last five years, and which arguably participates in ecocriticism by imagining the worlds that might exist after environmental collapse; novels like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road or Emily St. John Mandel’s Station 11 are examples of a similar strain of criticism in English-language literature. 
In this course we will examine ecocriticism’s history and the appearance and disappearance of environmental themes in German-language literature, film, and art over the course of the last two centuries. We will read and learn about: the Anthropocene and Industrial Revolution, Alexander von Humboldt, J. W. Goethe and Goethean science, Novalis, German Romanticism and the philosophy of nature, Adalbert Stifter, Ernst Haeckel and the reception of Darwinism in Germany, Wilhelm Riehl, Franz Kafka, the Blue Rider group, Martin Heidegger, the Frankfurt School, Ingeborg Bachmann, Joseph Beuys, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Elfriede Jelinek, Herta Müller, Sharon Dodua Otoo, Carl Amery and Germany’s Green Party, Yoko Tawada, Werner Herzog, Dorothee Elmiger and the European migration crisis, ecothriller film and more.Course Requirements:Short response papers and/or creative assignments; 6-8 page final paper.","Ewing,Megan Marie",GERMAN,303,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Environmentalism and Ecocriticism,3,HU,,,,Taught in English.,May be elected three times for credit.  
Topics in German Culture and the Arts,"Have you ever heard the words “schmooze,” “glitch,” or “kvetch”? These words entered English from Yiddish, the daily language of east European Jews. But Jews have spoken many other languages as well, including Hebrew, Aramaic, and Jewish versions of Arabic, Italian, and Spanish. As one historian put it, “one language was never enough for the Jews.” In this class, we will explore the fascinating role of languages in Jewish culture and history. Analyzing diverse materials from Passover Haggadahs to popular Netflix shows  Unorthodox  and  Shtisel, students will learn how, when, and why Jews have used different languages. Among our topics will be code-switching and the role of languages in ideological debates about topics such as Zionism, religion, and Holocaust memory. You do not need to have prior knowledge of any of the languages mentioned in this description.","Luchina,Elena",GERMAN,303,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Jewish Languages,3,HU,,,,Taught in English.,May be elected three times for credit.  
Topics in German Culture and the Arts,"Central Europe belongs to those unique historical amalgams whose composition defies disciplinary boundaries. The course traces this region’s complex history, culture, and its current spirit. Central European literature, theater, film, and visual art will be examined against the background of the tumultuous and often tragic events which left marks on the culture of Austrians, Czechs, and Germans during the 20th century. Symbiosis of these ethnic groups and their linguistic diversity will be discussed. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of Jewish culture in Central Europe. Jewish emancipation, disappearance of ghettoes, but also antisemitism and the Holocaust are among the topics. Another topic is the resistance against the Communist order and its eventual disintegration in 1989 as documented by works inspired by the fall of the Berlin wall. Authors to be read include Prague’s Jewish legends, Hašek’s Švejk, Kafka’s Trial, Kundera’s Joke, J.

Surprisingly, Freud’s great classic of 1900 is seldom actually read, with the result that many misconceptions about Freud’s actual research abound. This is the place where the modern concept of the unconscious as an object of rigorous research is first introduced, and Freud’s study of dreams yields powerful insight into the making of meaning in many different fields.","Amrine,Frederick R",GERMAN,304,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002," - Freud, Jung and the Unconscious",1,HU,,,,Taught in English.,May be elected three times for credit.

The Origins of Nazism,"Where did the Nazis come from? Was the Weimar Republic bound to fail? Did the Treaty of Versailles or the Great Depression catapult the Nazis into power? What was the role of racism, of Anti-Semitism? How did the regime consolidate itself? What was the role of ordinary people? How do we explain the Holocaust and what kind of war was the Second World War? Grappling with these and more questions, the first half of the course focuses on Germany’s first democracy, the Weimar Republic and its vibrant political culture. In the second half, we study the Nazi regime, how it consolidated its power and remade society based on the concepts of race and struggle. Discussions of race and race-making are crucial throughout the course. In the name of the “racial purity,” the Nazi state moved ruthlessly against Germany’s Jewish population and cleansed German society of all “undesirable” elements. These ideas and practices didn’t originate with the Nazis and they didn’t operate in a geopolitical vacuum. Thinking about Nazi racism and genocide in both its particular specifics and in a larger global historical context is the main goal of this course.","Thurman,Kira",GERMAN,322,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.

Intermediate German,"Students examine the German experience of warfare on the level of individual women, men, and children who lived through conflict as combatants, civilians, and bystanders. Personal experiences and perspectives are explored by means of the visual arts, film, literary fiction, memoirs, music, poetry, and personal correspondence. The chronological mold is broken by offering students a range of stopping points along the historical timeline that do not conform to linear sequencing, but instead prioritize the subjects’ intimate, personal experiences of warfare and its consequences. Here the term “German” is broadened to include the German historical imagination’s understanding of the concept when contemplating warfare. Thus students do not merely study those periods of war that one would expect to see in this course—the First and Second World Wars—they might also examine narratives from the victory of the Germanic tribes against the Roman legions in the Battle of Teutoburger Forest, the tribulations and deprivations of the Thirty Years War, and the Wars of Liberation fought against Napoleon.

We will also read important scholarship on the Grimms’ tales, while at the same time placing them within larger interpretive contexts such as psychoanalysis, structural anthropology, Marxist social critique, feminism, and Jungian psychology. Both the “iconography” and the “archaeology” of the fairy tale will be explored, as will the relationship between folk tales and at tales such as Shakespeare’s Tempest and Mozart’s Magic Flute.","Ewing,Megan Marie",GERMAN,386,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Faust Uncensored,"

The stories of Faust are as old as the Bible and as new as biotech. They are about the nature of evil, and about spirituality in conflict with both materialism and orthodox religion. We focus on the great versions by Marlowe, Goethe, Mann, and Bulgakov (hilarious and profound), but we also range widely in discussing theology (esp. Luther), psychology (Freud), political and religious censorship, magic and the beginnings of modern science, politics, and lots of music (esp. Beethoven, Schoenberg, and Shostakovich).
Some of the topics covered in lectures: Good and Evil — The myth of the Magus and the historical Dr. Faustus — Martin Luther and the theology of salvation — Magic and other Enchantments — The Chapbook of 1587 — Religion in 16th-century England — Christopher Marlowe and his world — Demonology — Mozart’s Don Giovanni and Gounod’s Faust — Freud on the interpretation of dreams — Mythology and the evolution of consciousness — Hegel’s and Goethe’s “phenomenology” — “The disenchantment of the world” — Tonality — Beethoven the revolutionary — Arnold Schoenberg, Mann, and the Nazis — “The Game of the Soviet Censor” — The Gospel of Socialist Realism — Shostakovich vs. Stalin — What is “Faustian”?Class Format:Taught in English.","Amrine,Frederick R",GERMAN,387,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,2 - 3,"ULWR, HU",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Germany and the Black Diaspora,"Taught in conjunction with University College London and the University of Missouri, this course explores global Black histories in an unlikely place: German-speaking Europe. This course is timely, too: as African migrants make the dangerous passage by ship to Europe to plead asylum in Germany and more neo-Nazi hate crimes take place, more public conversations in Central Europe are addressing what it means to have Black people on German lands. But students in this class will learn that people of African descent have always been a part of Central European history. From Black saint iconography in medieval churches to entertainers such as Josephine Baker or Beyoncé in Berlin, Germans have long engaged with and responded to Black figures in European history. In so doing, they have participated in global conversations on nationalism, colonialism, race, and gender. Students in this class will learn to think about Germany’s Black pasts in general and Afro-German history specifically while also developing their skills as digital humanists: together we will use blogs, learn digital mapping technologies, and curate an online digital museum exhibit to think about the humanities in the 21st centuries. Students will also collaborate closely with students at University College London and the University of Missouri on these projects. By working with peers on two continents and on three different campuses, students will engage deeply with questions of national identity, race, culture, and diaspora in the 19th and 20th centuries.","Thurman,Kira",GERMAN,396,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.

We will start in 1943 or the year that many people inside and outside of Nazi Germany considered the beginning of the end of National Socialism. We will frequently return to the following questions: 1) How did politicians, public intellectuals, and artists think about the National Socialist prehistory of the country and its meaning(s) for the present? 2) What does it mean to say that one state ends and another begins? What is the meaning of “new beginnings”? 3) What effect did the Third Reich and the Holocaust have on the way authors and visual artists thought about their work? 4) Which traces did the past leave in cities like Saarbrücken, Vienna, or Berlin, the capital of the Nazi Empire and the newly united East and West German states?

"Translating Modern Greek, Reporting the World","Every day, momentous events are reported in Greek: stories of refugees, austerity, protests, solidarity, creativity, humor, and human drama. This class challenges intermediate to advanced learners of Greek to build their linguistic, cultural, and global literacies by translating these and other texts. Materials are mostly present day reports, cartoons, creative works, commercials, advertisements, films, posters, and social media, in addition to creative literary writing. Using many tools and resources, we will reckon with the challenges of language transfer on the level of words, structures, tone, meaning, and broader cultural matters separating Greek from English. By practicing the craft of translation, students through its principles, process, purpose, and products; develop reading and research skills, produce good writing, and consider how texts circulate across borders. Students of different skill levels will learn to collaborate to recruit their different skills and solve problems together.

"""The Border Crossed Us"": Border Regimes in Global Contexts","Our world is defined by borders. Political, cultural, and linguistic containment and filtration systems cut through us and shape our sense of belonging. We carry them inside of us and reproduce them, through acts as simple as signing a passport, writing an essay in a standard dialect, or filling out an I-9 Form. This begs the question: what precisely are borders made of? How are they maintained, moved, or crossed? In this course we explore these questions through two comparative geographies: The Mediterranean and U.S./Mexico. Moving between literature, film, anthropology, archeology, law and climatology, we will examine the strategies by which communities are partitioned and policed in political space, in workplaces, and in language and cultural spaces, and the strategies by which they bleed across such partitions.","Stroebel, Will  ",GREEKMOD,360,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Introduction to African Art,"Through the study of a selected group of African and African Diaspora cultures, we will investigate several pivotal issues and narratives that lie behind the surfaces of some extraordinary objects and practices. African people have their own stories to tell about these things, of course: stories of mythic power expressed as living form, stories of historical contact with other cultures, stories of struggle and redemption, stories of ordinary, everyday life. And over the past several centuries, we in the “West” also have had a decisive, often disturbing hand in the framing of African peoples, objects and stories. The coupled histories of colonialism and the slave trade, along with our inevitably distorted views and representations of what African people are and what they do, have affected Africa and its peoples to the core. When we look at and think critically about “African Art,” then, we necessarily must look at and think critically about ourselves. Ultimately, the goal is to understand aspects of African cultures in the terms by which Africans understand them — to know African ideals and realities as they are shaped in word, sound, matter and movement.

 In this course we’ll be taking a few steps towards that goal. In lectures and weekly discussion sections, in films, recorded sound, and perhaps even in live performance, we will examine objects and the many stories that surround them. Looking and listening closely, we will learn to see and to understand a wide range of African visual practices including architecture, textiles, body adornment, painting, graphic communication systems, photography, dance, ritual performance and, of course, sculpture — not only as these practices continue to unfold on the African continent, but also as they are transformed, and as they endure, in the African Diaspora.

Introduction to Greek Archaeology,"In this introductory course we will focus on the evidence provided by art, architecture and artefacts, asking what they have to tell us about important ancient Greek cultural innovations such as the Olympic games, democracy, history, and theatre. We will also explore how the lives of ordinary people were affected by the social and technological changes taking place over the long period covered by the course (ca. 3000 BCE to 31 BCE). These include the introduction of bronze- and, subsequently, of iron-working; trade and the foundation of new settlements; the introduction, loss and re-adoption of a range of skills including the production of figurative art, monumental stone architecture and writing; and last (but not least) the rise, fall and re-birth of cities. To address these and other questions we look at some of the different research traditions and methods which have been employed in Greek art and archaeology over the past couple of centuries, down to the present day. No previous knowledge of ancient Greece or of art and archaeology is necessary.","Nevett,Lisa C",HISTART,221,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Visual Cultures of Ancient Rome,"Roman rulers waged war with images, vying with each other in life-and-death battles for supreme control of the ancient Roman world. Cities were aggrandized from Britain to Syria with great marble monuments to Roman leisure and wealth. Private individuals set up complex sculpted memorials to family, inserting their loved-ones into the material fabric of the city's, and the Empire's, claim to stability and status. Meanwhile, Roman homes glowed with multi-coloured mosaics and frescos, mapped onto floors, ceilings, walls, and matched in the carved detail of wooden furniture, and precious trinkets of silver and gems. The Roman Empire was awash with a rich and lively visual culture. This course surveys these vibrant visual arts of the Roman world from the late Republican period, down to the reign of Constantine (100BC – AD 336). It explores Roman visual culture across the provinces, and in a range of social spheres: civic, funerary, and domestic, among them. Students will be introduced to major objects and monuments produced for Roman patrons, as well as to lesser known works, which remain intriguing for the window they offer onto Roman aesthetic and social paradigms. Through this survey, the course will address the problematic question of how Roman art is ultimately to be defined. We will pay special attention to the function and significance of prominent themes such as portraiture, copying, naturalism, and classicism in Roman art. We will also engage with the difficult issue of how our own instincts about art, and our taxonomies of visual production, may actually hinder us in our attempt to grasp the priorities of effect inherent in Roman visual culture.","Barham,Nicola",HISTART,228,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Art and Life in 19th-Century America,"What can art history and American history tell us about each other? Painting, sculpture, photographs and popular media helped nineteenth-century Americans imagine race, nation, and spirituality while design shaped their environment. Ideas and images from this period inform the way we think today. We will study how the United States changed from a rural to an industrial, urban nation; slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction redefined the country, Westward movement and the accompanying confinement of Native peoples enlarged it, and waves of immigration and border movement changed its population. The rise of a middle class, a feminine ideal, and the accompanying notion of the ""American home"" were all products of the nineteenth century. American artists and architects sought to rival their European contemporaries and eventually produced distinctive works that responded to these national trends; today, contemporary artists of color are re-thinking 19th-century images. Through hands-on research in archives and visits to see original works of art in museums and libraries, along with readings in primary-source documents and recent critical interpretations, we will examine both developments in the fine arts and the impact of historical change on the material and popular culture of everyday life in America, as well as how nineteenth-century work now inspires contemporary artists. Among the artists and architects we will study are Thomas Cole, Winslow Homer, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Matthew Brady's photographic studio, Louis Sullivan, the Cheyenne artist Howling Wolf, Carrie Mae Weems, and contemporary Native American artists. The class will include a mandatory field trip to the Detroit Institute of Arts.","Zurier,Rebecca",HISTART,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Modern Art:  Avant-Garde to Contemporary,"

To quote Craig Damrauer:“Modern Art = I could do that + yeah, but you didn’t.” The course will survey twentieth-century art from Europe and the U.S. and investigate its novelty, profundity, and humor. We will cover the names you know (Picasso, Matisse, O’Keefe, Pollock) as well as works that you might not be so sure about (drip paintings, urinals, a woman hanging from the ceiling by a rope), all while developing a series of questions about the nature of art and its relationship to the social and political context from which it emerged.   Not only will this course provide an overview of the twentieth-century, Western art, it will equip you with the background necessary to begin to understand the art of the twenty-first.

Art and Empire in Antiquity,"This course explores the ways in which visual art and built landscapes work as tools of imperial persuasion, ambition, and legitimization. It focuses on hallmark monuments of ancient Egypt, Iraq, and Iran, while bringing in comparative material from Classical Athens and early imperial Rome, the Soviet Union, and the United States. At the outset, we integrate concepts of “empire” with historical overviews of the core civilizations of Egypt and the Near East. We also explore key concepts of race, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and status as markers of validating incorporation or demonizing marginalization and Otherness. These issues then weave through the entire term within selected case studies of visual art, material culture, and architectural landscape. We lay out strategies for seeing and interpreting works of art and architecture around the thematic axis of the course. We consider how to look at representations and structures as visual, material, and performative things; how to interpret representational (and spatial) dynamics from vantage points of a cultural insider as well as from vantage points of a theoretical range of outsider, resistant audiences; how to read coded messages of symbols and metaphors that speak to, for, and about the condition of being in empire at a particular cultural-historical moment and on a particular ideological platform. Put a different way, we explore ways of using art and architecture as critical sources that help us indeed to fathom the nature of the imperial ideology we find ourselves in the middle of. Sometimes we find that the visual speaks more eloquently or richly on the same theme offered by written texts of the period; sometimes we find that the visual offers an alternative message to that disseminated through the written word; and sometimes we encounter situations in which the visual is the only record we have as a primary source. All three possibilities show the significance of learning how to give voice to the visual, material, and spatial on the challenge of considering ancient empires. We encourage creative thinking around these issues by inviting the students to bring in evidence from current media presentations (such as photo journalism). 
 The historical narrative arc of HISTART 286 moves from the beginnings of complex state formations with burgeoning expansionist agendas (around 3,000 BCE) to a culmination in the Persian empire of c. 550-330 BCE — the first “universal empire,” which controlled a dominion from the Indus to the Danube and across all of North Africa including Egypt. The Persian Empire was in a sense the final creative packaging of venerable ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern traditions. Its ideology was built around visions of a universal family of people from all the lands, harmoniously cooperating in the imperial endeavor. In this, it was a radical departure from earlier ideologies, even as the art that was created to help forge and maintain the empire systematically mined the Usable Pasts of the subject lands. The Persian Empire was intimately connected to Classical Athens and to Athenian imperial ambitions in the aftermath of the Persian Wars. At this juncture, the Persians came to form the paradigm of the alien, demonized “other” in antithesis to the West—a paradigm that it is fair to say persists in variant modes to the present day. Thus, the Persian Empire and its art emerges in HISTART 286 as a pivotal case study with which we compare the ethos and representational strategies in empire of the Parthenon of Classical Athens and then those of the Ara Pacis and statue of Augustus of Prima Porta of the early Roman Empire (which in certain important ways deliberately cast back to Classical Athens for models of representation). Brief encounters with classicizing monuments of Washington DC and their tropes (e.g., of feminized, despondent Native Americans within the landscape of Manifest Destiny) complete the narrative arc so as to bring it to a setting of some cultural familiarity. In addition to the collections resources of the Kelsey Museum, HISTART 286 benefits from efforts already undertaken (aided by funds from CMENAS) in the development of some web-based instructional materials. New efforts in digital instruction are gearing up around a new special exhibition for Fall 2013 led by Professor Root (Ancient Animations: Experiencing Visual Expression in the Persian Empire). Students in HISTART 286 beginning in Fall 2011 will be able to take advantage of this activity, having the excitement of serving as de facto focus groups around brainstorming for the project. In subsequent years of the course, the digital product of the exhibition itself will be available as an interactive learning tool. Course Requirements:Seven papers ranging from 250-word précis and critical commentaries on specific readings, to 250-word essays on encounters with specific works of art and/or thinking questions, to a 750-word original research paper with endnotes and a short bibliography (9-10 double-spaced pages). Several of the assignments will be shared for blind peer-review assessment as classroom or section exercises. Mid-term and final will mix short-essay responses and more objective questioning to enable students to address visual material studied in the course and demonstrates their acquired skills in knowledge-building in art history, in critical synthesis of ideas, and in ways of dealing effectively with cross-cultural comparisons around art and empire. Attendance and participation in weekly discussions.Intended Audience:First-fourth year students, History of Art concentrators/minors, Museum Studies minors, students across LS&A (including but not limited to Anthropology, Near Eastern Studies, and Classical Studies), and students in, e.g., the School of Art and Design/School of Engineering.

Special Topics,"The way space is visualized, imagined, and experienced has been instrumental to the global constitution of race. Maps are often regarded as the most accurate multidimensional tools for graphically representing air, land, sea, and beyond. In their various forms, maps aesthetically, textually, and materially convey how African Diasporic peoples understand the spaces they claim and inhabit. Expanding from familiar modes of scientifically charting area, this course broadly examines how space is conceived across artistic and expressive genres. Assigned readings temporally link visual economies of race and (dis)placement from early modernity to the present via Black global, hemispheric, and regional approaches.

At these sites, we will read ancient inscriptions, uncover forgotten settlements, and enter fresco-crowded shrines crowded with glimmering statuary. Then, will traverse through alpine meadows and glaciers to witness how development pressures and climate change are transforming ecologically fragile landscapes and diverse cultures. Thereafter, we will cross high passes and briefly enter adjacent lands including war-torn Afghanistan to see how the region's cultural heritage is being preserved and Tibetan Plateau to survey how ethnically Tibetan artists are responding to Chinese occupation.

The Miraculous and the Diabolical in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe,"In this course we will investigate 'supernatural' phenomena in the visual arts: divine acts, miracles, magic, and sorcery. We will be interested in how and why people in late medieval and early modern Europe distinguished between the 'supernatural' and the 'natural', as well as the extreme fluidity of these terms. We will investigate how certain 'supernatural' occurrences were considered to have been caused by God, saints, and holy men and women, while others were said to be the work of the devil, demons, sorcerers, witches, and tricksters. A variety of artistic media and genres will be studied: narrative paintings, prints, miraculous images, votive objects, relics and reliquaries, incantations, and prayers. We will also be interested in how conceptions about the miraculous and diabolical were applied to artists and to works of art: the 'divine' Michelangelo was compared to the supreme animator, God; figures of devils in paintings were defaced in order to prevent evil forces from acting through the images. Our inquiry will extend beyond the boundaries of Europe and consider modern day experiences for comparative purposes. Assignments include two reading response papers (4 pages), a mid-term exam and a final exam.","Holmes,Megan L",HISTART,355,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Expressive Cultures of the Black Atlantic:  Vision and Time,"This is a reading-intensive course that spans a wide range of Black Atlantic cultures by focusing on the roles of visual arts and performance in the production of historical memory. 

In this course we will examine a diversity of Black Atlantic visual cultures, both in Africa and in the Diaspora, with a focus on how historical memory and the experience of the passage of time are articulated in objects and performances. What, for example, are the poetics of trying to reclaim historical “African” origins when such a reconstruction is by definition impossible? The idea of allegory will run strongly through the course: the mourning of lost “ancient” wholeness marked also by the enduring hope that fragments of the past can be reassembled to redeem the present. This is not to say that the people whose lives and works we will discuss here are abjectly “living in the past”—though this very misconception has been rehearsed often in museum exhibitions devoted to the objectifying study of “Other” cultures. We will concentrate on the ways in which the realities of a shifting present are addressed throughout the African Diaspora: in struggle, in celebration, and always in movement. Topics will include the construction of ritual altars in Haiti and Cuba; the carnival arts of Brazil, New Orleans and Trinidad; the sculpting of memory in recycled objects in the American South and in the sonic spaces of hip-hop; and other phenomena. Course Requirements:Student performance will be based heavily on weekly reading summaries and participation in classroom discussion. Each student also will be responsible for a class presentation of one week’s readings. A final project will consist of a “performance” that will synthesize the semester’s material in a way unique to each student. This may be in the form of a lecture, a film or video, a website, an interactive sculpture, among other possibilities. This project will also include a written component. Intended Audience:The course is intended for advanced students with diverse academic interests: religion, performance studies, anthropology, Atlantic studies. Concentrators in African and African-American studies, music, and History of Art are especially welcome. Class Format:3 hours per week, seminar meetings, no GSI involvement.

Realism and Impressionism,"This course focuses on Parisian visual culture during the second half of the nineteenth century. This is the period during which progressive painters, grouped loosely under the rubrics Realism and Impressionism, dramatically transformed the formal and thematic possibilities of their medium, despite stubborn resistance from the Académie des Beaux-Arts, the Paris Salon, and the general public. It is also the period that witnessed massive increases in the availability and marketability of print media, including photography, caricature, and advertising posters. Our objectives include:","Lay,Howard G",HISTART,370,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Weimar Culture,"The Weimar Republic, Germany's first experiment in democracy, lasted between 1918/19 and 1933. It began with the fall of the German monarchy at the end of World War I and ended a little more than fourteen years later when the National Socialist Party assumed power through a mixture of legal and illegal means. Although brief, the Weimar Republic witnessed a rich and diverse array of ""high"" and ""popular"" culture; including visual art, performance, sculpture, film, theater, literature, posters, illustrated books and magazines. Empowered by the breakdown of the established order, and with the firm belief that not only society but also the individual had to be remade from the ground up, the creators of Weimar culture engaged all the means at their disposal to visualize a new world and a new consciousness to go with it. This course will examine various competing visions of the new individual and new society as they are presented in Weimar Culture, and how fascist, socialist and democratic forces battled to define the modern individual and society.","Biro,Matthew Nicholas",HISTART,371,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to Egyptian Archaeology,"In this course, we will focus on the material culture and spatial disposition of archaeological sites in northeast Africa, specifically ancient Egyptian and Middle Nile Valley cultures from c. 3200-656 BCE. We will learn about the people who created the objects we study, the logic and nature of both sacred and secular sites they built and inhabited, and the impact of new discoveries on our understanding of the past. We will explore in-depth specific sites, some well-known (such as Tutankhamen’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings, the pyramids at Giza, and Karnak temple), some less well known (such as the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities’ excavations at numerous sites through the Valley, the city of Kerma in northern Sudan, UM’s ongoing excavation at Abydos in Upper Egypt), investigating them as examples of different kinds of interpretive problems in archaeology. We will also consider theoretical approaches to Nile Valley archaeological data, the ways in which material culture remains articulate with other sources of information, issues of stakeholders past and present of cultural heritage including the politics of archaeology and repatriation initiatives; and we'll consider the implications of how ancient Egypt and archaeology appears in film, TV, and other media of public culture. Finally, throughout we will emphasize archaeology of lived experience, not just the privileged environments of political elites, but also the settlements, cemeteries, and cult areas of the communities and individuals who were the majority of the ancient Egyptian population.","Richards,Janet E",HISTART,382,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Modern Art in a Multi-Ethnic Asia,"This course discusses modern and contemporary art in Asia (construed in this context as the countries comprising East, Southeast, and South Asia) as a function of the encounter between groups identified primarily on the basis of their racial and ethnic origin. Roughly beginning from the late 18th century, this course looks particularly at two modes of encounter; one turns on race (the encounter between the so-called West and the non-West, largely construed as the relationship between whites and Asians) and the other on ethnicity (the tensions and symbioses arising out of inter-regional encounters between Manchus and Han Chinese, Chinese and Taiwanese, Koreans and Japanese, as well as Japanese and Okinawans/Ainus). Much of the material discussed in this class asks how constructs of race and ethnicity arise out of the production of visual representation. Drawing upon a wide range of media from woodblock prints documenting the entry of white male traders into Yokohama to performances by Hong Kong artists in the late 1990s that exclusively mix Mandarin and Cantonese as a way of asserting their autonomy from mainland China, this works shown in this class posits whether both constructs are, in fact, performative. If so, for whom is such performance intended and why?","Kee,Joan",HISTART,383,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,At least one course in either History of Art or Asian Studies.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Anime to Zen:  Japanese Art through Contemporary Popular Culture,"What is the place of recent Japanese visual culture in the larger history of the Japanese art? Can it illuminate our understanding of earlier art and vice versa? This course examines examples of premodern and contemporary popular visual culture in order to illuminate fundamental themes common to many times and people throughout the Japan. The lectures do not present a survey of modern art, nor are they meant to be in any way comprehensive. Yet they will examine a wide variety of films, photography, painting, sculpture, architecture, comics, advertisements, websites, and new media as lenses through which we will focus our exploration of concepts about nature and place, personal and national identity, fantasy and virtual realities, humanity and its borders, superheros in a cross-cultural context, beauty and ugliness, violence and war, the body, gender, sex, and consumption. We will also explore parallels between the United States and Japan in recent decades, considering the ways that visual cultures manifest and shape soft power in recent decades.","Carr, Kevin Gray",HISTART,392,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Undergraduate Seminar,"This course looks at visual art made under the conditions of confinement and imprisonment, principally in the context of the criminal justice system. Prisons have become dynamic sites of artistic activity, with incarcerated artists engaged in drawing, painting, 3D construction, and tattoo designs, using materials that are readily available. We will explore the relationship between the restrictive conditions of incarceration, on the one hand, and the expression of creativity and a visual imaginary, a ""carceral aesthetic,"" and the socio-economic and cultural dimensions of prison art within and outside of carceral institutions, on the other hand. While the focus will be on mass incarceration within the United States, there will also be a historical and cross-cultural consideration of other contexts in which visual art has been produced by enclosed populations within institutions of confinement (like early modern European nunneries and plague hospitals, and modern internment camps). A critical component of this seminar will be involvement in the University of Michigan Prison Creative Arts Program (PCAP)—either in facilitating a PCAP visual arts workshop (if these workshops are run remotely through correspondence in the winter) or by engaging with the PCAP Annual Exhibition of Art by Michigan Prisoners.","Holmes,Megan L",HISTART,393,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Visual Art and Incarceration,3,HU,,,,W.,May be elected five times for credit.

Undergraduate Seminar,"Alongside its importance for understanding color, light, form, density, and dimension, this seminar explores how blackness has been deployed throughout Atlantic World visual culture to connote death, emptiness, and chaos. From Robert Fludd's The Great Darkness to Kasimir Malevich's Black Square, two-dimensional monochrome images invite varied interpretations. While Fludd invoked blackness to depict the infinite void preceding the universe's creation, Malevich scrawled the racist phrase ""Negroes battling in a cave"" onto his canvas before covering it with paint. The creatures populating H.P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror alongside the Marvel Comics character Venom are among other case studies in which blackness is portrayed as amorphous monstrosity. During our collaborative study, we will ultimately trouble taken for granted distinctions between 'racial blackness' and 'non-racial blackness' by critically theorizing blackness' multivalence throughout the arts and expressive cultures.","Cooper, Cecilio M",HISTART,393,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002," - Back to Black: Race, Nothingness + Disorder",3,HU,,,,W.,May be elected five times for credit.

Undergraduate Seminar,"How do artists respond to the socio-political events of their past/present/potential future? How does conflict shape the kind of work artists are able to make? How does art thrive under systems of oppression or in times of war? This course examines how art and artists have documented and responded to conflict and its aftermath in the Middle East in the modern and contemporary eras. We will investigate artists and works (both from the Middle East and the cultures who have interacted with the region in conflict) including artist responses to the post-Ottoman era and colonialism in the Middle East, the Nakba and establishment of the state of Israel, civil wars in Lebanon and Syria, the Iran-Iraq War, both Gulf Wars, the Arab Spring, and responses to domestic/local conflicts within the region. Students will develop skills in visual analysis, critical thinking, and academic writing. These skills will be demonstrated through in-class work, reading responses, an in-class presentation, and a final research paper on an artist, work, or conflict/socio-political event of the student’s choice. No prior knowledge of the Middle East or its history or of art history required. This course will meet entirely remotely. We will meet biweekly for synchronous discussion on Zoom. These meetings are required, though there will be ways to make up missing the occasional class, understanding the unpredictability of our current moment. However this can not be used as a replacement for synchronous participation. You will be required to complete some work asynchronously prior to these meetings.

Why did European women wear Ottoman clothing at fancy dress balls in the 18 th and 19 th centuries? What was the appeal of French silks to discerning Ottoman women? How did Ottoman women learn about European fashions and why did they choose to wear them? By centering on the Ottoman fashion story, broadening the typical narrative to look beyond elite clothing to the dress of working women, and bringing in considerations of race and ethnicity we will understand a fashion history very different than the standard histories of women's dress in this period. Through an examination of relevant garments, visual documents such as photographs and manuscript paintings, and primary texts (traveler's accounts, fashion media), students will learn how fashion history is constructed and what it means to decolonize that history.","Micklewright,Nancy",HISTART,395,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Decolonizing Fashion: Ottoman and Euro-American Dress, 1700-1920",2,HU,Minicourse,,,,May be elected five times for credit.

Archaeology of the Roman Provinces,"The study of empires has traditionally focused on the society and culture of the conqueror, and the diverse means by which it maintained and manifested its power. More recently, however, attention has been given to the lives of the conquered and the degree to which these imperial subjects accommodated — or resisted — their rulers. In line with this development, this course revolves around a pair of related questions: how were the inhabitants of territories incorporated within the Roman empire affected by becoming part of a larger imperial world? And did provincial residents in turn have any impact upon the central power of Rome? This course will examine a sample of provinces drawn from various geographic and climatic zones as well as from societies with a range of pre-existing political formations. For each of these regions similar themes will be explored, allowing us, at the end of the course, to evaluate the nature of the Roman empire and the degree to which it was a unified entity.","Stone,David",HISTART,424,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,"Upperclass standing, and CLARCH/HISTART 221 or 222.",,May not be repeated for credit.
The Art and Archaeology of Asia Minor,"This course provides a chronological survey of the art and archaeology of western Turkey, the place the Greeks called Anatolia, “the land of the rising sun,” from the late Bronze Age (15th-12th centuries BC) to the mid-Hellenistic period (2nd century BC).  The course begins by examining the collapse of Aegean Bronze Age civilization from an Anatolian perspective, focusing especially on the archaeology of Troy and the Trojan War, and on the Hittite empire.  We will then consider the reemergence of town life in the Iron Age (11th to 6th centuries BC) and the formation of independent kingdoms in places such as Phrygia and Lydia, the lands of Midas and Croesus.  Special attention will be paid to the role of Anatolia as an intermediary between the Greek cities of Ionia, on the western coast of Turkey, and the complex civilizations of the ancient Near East – in subjects as diverse as architectural ornament, the evolution of urban form, bronze casting, and the adoption of a written script.  In the 6th century BC, Anatolia was conquered by Persian invaders, who established a unified system of government that lasted until the coming of Alexander the Great in the mid-4th century BC.  In examining the Persian period in Anatolia, we will focus on the career of Mausolus, whose eponymous tomb, the Mausoleum, built and decorated by some of the most famous Greek architects and artists of his day, became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.  The last section of the course will consider the influence of the Anatolian heritage on the development of Hellenistic Greek civilization in sites such as Pergamon, which emerged as the capital of a powerful independent kingdom in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.  The archaeological evidence considered in this course comes mainly from excavations carried out at town-sites and monumental cemeteries, and the course will also investigate contemporary developments in Anatolian archaeology, including new research strategies such as regional survey in addition to ongoing excavation.","Ratte,Christopher John",HISTART,435,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,Upperclass standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Special Topics in Art and Culture,"The course focuses on interfaces of Soviet visual arts and related domains, including political propaganda, that characterizes the years of Revolution, the NEP Period, and Stalinism in the USSR, i.e., the years between the revolutions of 1917 and Stalin’s death in 1953. Among other things, we will study modern print media, ranging from poster art to publishing projects such as the magazine USSR in Construction, but also such domains that display distinct visual aspects without necessarily being prime foci of visual culture, e.g., the culture of festivities and visual aspects of the public space. We will also discuss profiles of artists who were active in forging the bridge between the avant-garde and political art (Klucis, Lissitski, Rodchenko). Time permitting, some of these domains will be compared— and contrasted— with similar phenomena in interwar Germany, especially as regards the culture of photo-illustrated magazines and book covers, visual aspects of the public space, or the cult of personality. Western contributions to Soviet visual culture will also be discussed.","Toman,Jindrich",HISTART,489,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Soviet Visual Culture: 1917-1953,3,,,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

Upper-Level Seminar,"Starting from the premise that race plays itself out visually, the course explores the relationship between art, materiality, space, and race. In addition to reading foundational literature in critical race studies including W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde, our inquiries will be grounded by five case studies: South Africa, Germany, India, Mexico, and the US. Each one of these cases will provide a conception of race rooted in local histories and cultures. By analyzing the visual and material dimensions of apartheid, antisemitism, xenophobia, slavery, and colonization through these case studies, we will articulate a multidimensional understanding of race as a historical concept. However, to ask how race has shaped visual culture also has global implications, as demonstrated by the recent removal of racists monuments across the world. Thus, by looking at each case study in comparison, students will develop an understanding of both the global and the local ramifications of racism and the antiracist movement. Objects, buildings, places, paintings, names, sculptures,s and public art will structure our weekly debates. Students will engage in visual analysis and independent research for their final assessment.","Lay,Howard G",HISTART,497,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,Previous coursework in the History of Art.,,May be elected three times for credit.

This course will explore the histories and ongoing presence of murals across the state of Michigan. Though we will focus on local and regional murals, larger topics will include: the role of public art in American communities, the Mexican Muralism movement, and the use of murals in contemporary struggles for social and environmental justice.

The Writing of History,"Before the foundations for the Eiffel Tower were laid, or the City of Lights strung with a single streetlamp, Paris was a rough and tumble maze of crooked medieval streets, overflowing cemeteries, and dismal sanitation. Tracing Paris's transformation into the first modern metropolis in the West—one with broad boulevards, street lighting, public squares, a police force, and even public restroom facilities—this class will ask students to analyze and write about the city as a historical artifact. Using police archives, memoirs, songs, images, and films, we will examine how ""ordinary"" Parisians experienced the changing city, dwelling at length on the experiences of women and colonial citizens. We will examine how the creation of public spaces and amenities fostered novel urban experiences, but also reinforced racial and gendered inequalities among the city's residents. And, finally, we will reflect on how and why Paris came to hold such power over twentieth-century American writers and artists, using films and magazine articles as jumping-off points for our own written reflections.","Bowen, Haley E  ",HISTORY,195,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Reinventing Paris, 1600 to the Present",4,FYWR,,,,This course may not be included in a History major.

The Writing of History,"The course is structured around the history of the Indian subcontinent and will ask challenging questions about the concepts of empire and nation-states as two forms of political community that have structured the way diverse peoples have come to live together. Through different styles of academic and non-academic writing we will think about how imperial rulers and national leaders in the past forged concepts and policies in an attempt to create harmony between the diverse people that lived under their rule. Together we will analyze different historical sources to identify the ethical protocols that motivated Mughal emperors to craft the ideologies of their dispensations. You will encounter the rhetorical strategies utilized by British colonizers to justify their rule over an alien people, and study the writings of Indian nationalist leaders to see how they responded to the challenge of envisioning a political community in which a plural people could live together in peace. How were the nationalists different from the imperialists and colonists who preceded them in their attempts to define modes of belonging to a common political community? What role did women and the question of women's rights play in the imagination of an independent Indian nation? We will encounter different genres of writing—chronicles, speeches, short stories, novels, newspaper articles, as well as film—to get to the heart of these themes and questions. Students will be encouraged to use the process of writing analytical essays to develop original ideas about the history of empires and nations with the Indian subcontinent as the backdrop.

First-Year Seminar in the Humanities,"The modern city is located at the intersection of built form and human imagination. Cities are as much about intangible ideas as they are about material facts; as much about construal as they are about construction. These two aspects of cities, moreover, cannot be separated from one another, either in scholarly analyses or in the lived experiences of people who inhabit them. At the heart this first year seminar is the modern city—a type of city that emerges in the nineteenth century—where the shock of the crowd, supra-human landscapes of industry, promiscuous forms of sociality, and unprecedented wealth alongside bone-breaking poverty have long made the city a place of both danger and promise. Modern urban experience, in turn, is one of constant, inexorable, and irreversible change—in social relationships, in sources of authority, and the in materiality of everyday life. This course will explore these intersections of built form, experience, and urban imagination in a diverse range cultural and geographical settings: from London, Paris, New York, and Chicago in the Anglo-European world; to Lagos, Mumbai, New Delhi, and Jakarta in Africa and Asia. In each of these settings we will question how urban imagination shapes the way people live in the city—and what consequences urban imagination has for the way people live together in the city.","Glover,William J",HISTORY,197,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Urban Form/Urban Imagination: The Modern City in History,3,HU,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.

It surveys ancient, medieval, and early modern interactions of animals and people, showing both the impact that animals had on European cultures, societies, and economies from about 100 BC to 1800 AD, and how humans’ economic strategies and cultural choices affected animals.","Squatriti,Paolo",HISTORY,197,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - The Beast Within: People and Animals in Preindustrial Europe,3,HU,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.
Rome,"Who were ""the Romans""? At its peak, the Roman empire encompassed the entire Mediterranean region—and beyond. No single state had ever consolidated this vast territory (nor has any since); to be ""Roman"" came to mean many things for the millions of people who made up this multiethnic empire. How did this happen, and what can we learn from it? The course will take a range of approaches to these questions, focusing on the second century BCE through the fourth century CE. Lectures will combine Roman political history with the study of culture and everyday life. This means we will engage deeply with topics such as gender, sexuality, slavery, domestic life, identity, and religion. Students will learn about the rise and fall of dynasties, the Roman frontier, and the tapestry of cultures in the empire, while also gaining a sense of what it would have been like to live in the ancient Mediterranean world. Discussion sections will focus on ancient texts and some modern scholarship, as well as art and material culture of the Roman world.","Freidin,Anna Bonnell",HISTORY,201,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,W.,May not be repeated for credit.
Doing History,"
The course provides a structured and cohesive foundation in the analytical, methodological, compositional, and historiographical skills involved in “doing history.”  Students will encounter a diverse set of primary sources in order to evaluate how historians identify and interpret the clues, evidence, and omissions in the historical record.  Students also will read secondary historical texts on selected subjects, with a focus on historiographical debates over competing interpretations of the past and consideration of the various approaches of political, social, cultural, and other subfields of history.  In addition to the critical analysis of primary and secondary sources, HISTORY 202 focuses on the practice of historical writing and the development of research skills, preparing students for the requirements of more advanced history courses, especially the capstone Junior/Senior Colloquium.  
HISTORY 202 also introduces concentrators to ways of “doing history” outside the classroom, from archival research to public history.  As a group, the seminar will visit one or more of the research libraries affiliated with the University of Michigan for hands-on experience with primary sources and manuscript collections.  Individual sections of HISTORY 202 might take field trips to museums and other public history sites in Southeast Michigan, in order to explore the presentation of history and the operation of historical memory in action.

Modern East Asia,"This course is an introduction to the history of China, Korea, and Japan from 1600 to the present, with emphasis on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Main themes include: the cultural and socio-political dynamics of imperial, kingly, and feudal states (the Ming and Qing dynasties in China, the Tokugawa and Meiji regimes in Japan, and the Joseon dynasty in Korea); the expansion of Western imperialism during the nineteenth century and the revolutions, reforms, and realignments that it provoked; and the rise of China, Japan, and Korea into global economic powers during the twentieth century. In addition to exploring issues of class, ethnicity, and gender, specific topics include the end of dynastic rule and the rise of communism in China, Japan's emergence as an imperialist power, and Korea's efforts to assert autonomy in the face of colonialism and great power competition. Taking a broad comparative perspective on East Asia, the course explores the inter-relations between political economy, society, and culture in each country within an emerging modern world system. While this course is a chronological continuation of History 204, there are no prerequisites and no previous background on the subject is required.","Wu,Yi-Li",HISTORY,205,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Sports in World History,"Sports are a seemingly universal feature of societies across the world. From soccer to cricket, from baseball to the Olympic Games, sports constitute connections across space and time. This course examines the reach of sports with attention to scale and theory. We'll look at the following questions over the term: What can turning our attention to different contexts and different times tell us about the purpose and development of sports? How can sports shed light on constructions of gender, sexuality, and race? What are the links between sports and political power, state building, social protest, and globalization? What separates sports today from athletics in the premodern world? This course will approach the above through different problem-based modules, which will introduce students to the theoretical underpinnings of world history.","Wroblewski, Kathleen  ",HISTORY,208,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Death, Immortality, and Afterlife","“What makes us human?” We may think that it is our ability to use language, or our capacity for abstract thinking, making history, crafting art, and developing religions, or is it our cognitive facility to conceptualize death and immortality? This course aims to answer these questions by resorting to the long and distant past, known as deep history, that spans from the prehistorical to the present. Realizing that this question goes beyond the capacity of any single academic discipline, we turn to history, cultural anthropology, archaeology, palaeontology, developmental psychology, comparative religions, art, and literature to explore the universal human search for the meaning of death and immortality. Cultural practices around death and immortality, like burial and mortuary rituals and telling stories about the afterlife, have marked the human experience since the emergence of homo sapiens. This course maps such practices to probe into the uniqueness of human beings compared to our closest hominid ancestors, especially the Neanderthals, to ask if they also have ritual burials, and if they so, how does this change our definition of being human. We then turn to the beginnings of the religious expression in prehistory leading to the foundations of the world’s major religions. Finally, we end by exploring how present communities imagine, negotiate, and ritualize the deaths of the living and the lives of the dead.","Al-Rustom,Hakem Amer",HISTORY,209,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Later Medieval Europe, 1000-1500","In the year 1000, Europe was a rural backwater, barely able to feed its growing population, and riven with the violence of competing warlords. By 1500, Europeans were crossing the Atlantic Ocean, trading directly with China, and powerful king's ruled large territories unified by law. This course looks at how Europe emerged from the margins of the world's stage in this period by examining events like the Crusades, the Black Death, and the invention of the printing press, the rise of institutions like monarchies, the Church, and human bondage, and by looking at long term changes to the medieval climate. We will also ask, who belonged to this emerging world and who was steadily excluded? Where did the idea of nations come from? And we will ask, what is the relationship between the real Middle Ages and the fantasy one that fills video games, white-supremacist politics, and the news media?","French,Katherine L",HISTORY,211,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,W.,May not be repeated for credit.
War and Society in the 20th Century: World War I,"Contemporaries experienced World War I both as an exhilarating revolution and as a terrible revelation. The conflict radically changed social and political life and revealed that modernity was anything but a synonym of progress. We will approach the war from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. First, this will be a course in political and military history, meant to familiarize students with the main coordinates of the conflict in terms of diplomatic, economic, and technological developments. Second, this course will deal with the many meanings historical actors themselves attributed to the conflict and the ways they experienced it from a multitude of class, gender, religious, ideological, and ethnic/racial perspectives. For that, we will look at a variety of cultural artifacts, ranging from literary memoirs to popular and “high” music, and from soldiers’ poetry to their private letters. Finally, the course will probe the relationships between history and memory, assessing the distance between our vision of the war in today’s popular culture and the many visions that competed with each other a century ago. We will sample some of the ways the war has been memorialized, discussing whether a truly detached and objective understanding is possible or even desirable.","Gaggio,Dario",HISTORY,216,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Communism and Capitalism in Eastern Europe,"



The Cold War was said to be a battle between the forces of ""Communism"" and ""Capitalism."" But what do these ideologically-loaded categories look like in practice? This course explores Communist and Capitalist economic and political systems as they played out in East Central Europe (1945 to the present), focusing on  people's daily lives, their material culture, their understanding of their rights as citizens, and their political position between East and West.   Students will follow two countries from the region throughout the course.  Feature films from East Central Europe will constitute part of the required assignments.Course Requirements:No prior knowledge of the region is expected or necessary.Intended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:No data submitted","Fehervary,Krisztina E",HISTORY,228,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to Historical Anthropology,"Cultural anthropology can be described as the study of how people “do things differently” throughout the many societies and cultures around the world; social history is the study of how societies and cultures have changed over time. History and cultural anthropology clearly have a lot to say to each other. How has “the past” become “a foreign country”? Through what processes did “so alien a Then become so familiar a Now” ? How are our present societies and cultures connected to our own pasts and to the pasts of others? What historical paths have led to the cultural differences we find around the world today? These questions are both anthropological and historical, and it takes the combined skills and techniques of both disciplines to address them. An anthropological awareness of cultural diversity also alerts us to the very real possibility that different cultures may have different ideas about “history.” How did the past happen? How “present” is it? How do we remember it? In writing? Through oral traditions? In other ways? How is the past inscribed in traces in the environment? How do social memories of the past shape cultures in the present? Are there conflicts within society about how the past should shape the present? How do social actors actively define and inscribe the past, perhaps in a struggle to control the present and future? How do conflicts over the meaning of the past reveal truths about social tensions, divisions, and processes in the present? In this course, we will study the convergences of anthropology and history from two angles: the uses of historical research to explain and illuminate cultural difference; and the use of anthropological research to understand cultural differences in approaches to history. Our objectives are to develop an anthropological sensitivity to the everyday workings of history, and to become more aware of how history is never “history” (in the colloquial sense of being over and done with), but is constantly being negotiated—and is constantly at work shaping the possibilities of our future.","Frye,David L",HISTORY,229,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Humanities Topics in History,"Idi Amin was one of history's most infamous dictators. As president of Uganda between 1971 and 1979 he earned an international reputation as ""The Butcher of Uganda,"" and as many as 300,000 people are said to have perished under his brutal rule. In any catalogue of dictators of the twentieth century, Amin is near the top, alongside Hitler, Pol Pot, and Stalin.  Within Uganda, though, Amin was regarded by many as a hero: a pioneering nationalist who played a key role in re-engineering the country's economy and expanding its international role. In this course we'll study how Amin's regime generated support, created consensus, and unified Ugandans around the president's program. Our focus will be on the media—radio, television, and print—by which the Amin government set the tempo of public life. We'll be working with a wide range of historical materials that the Amin government generated. We'll look at the thousands of pictures made by Idi Amin's personal photographers. We'll listen to radio addresses made by President Amin and broadcast over Radio Uganda. We'll watch televised film. And we'll read though a great number of archival files created by government officials.  By the end of the semester I hope that you'll have gained insight into how dictatorships work, how they command consent and shape people's sense of place, time, and history. And—I hope—you will have learned how to think like a historian: how to mine usable information from unfaithful, self-interested, self-inflating, propagandistic source material. These are skills that are as consequential for us, in twenty-first century America, as at any time in our history.","Peterson,Derek R",HISTORY,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - How to be a Dictator: Idi Amin in Uganda?s History,3,HU,,,,,May be elected five times for credit.

Humanities Topics in History,"This course looks at the history of sports and games in the Middle East to examine how entertainment and spectacle become arenas of warfare, gender disparity, religious piety, social movement, diplomatic strategy, cultural heritage, discrimination, and history making. In October 2021, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, chaired by crown-prince Mohammad bin Salman, led an ownership takeover of the English Premier League Football Club Newcastle United. Saudi Arabia is the third oil-rich state to invest heavily in major soccer teams, following the Abu Dhabi United Group (United Arab Emirates) ownership of Manchester City Football Club and the Qatar Sports Investments group ownership of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. These three Gulf states with questionable human rights records have been accused of sportswashing — using the popularity of football and sports to build positive worldwide reputations. From board games played by pharaohs, kings, and queens found in ancient tombs such as the Royal Game of Ur from ancient Mesopotamia or Senet from ancient Egypt to the popularity of Chess in medieval Islamic courts and empires to the 2007 formation and 2021 extraction of the Afghanistan women's national football team and to the upcoming 2022 Qatar World Cup, sporting and games have been the locus of delight, community, terror, rebellion, and political intrigue throughout the Middle East.","Crisostomo, Jay  ",HISTORY,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004,,3,HU,,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  
Humanities Topics in History,"This lecture-based course considers the relationship between gender and war. It asks what is the role of gender in war, and war on gender. We introduce concepts such as: combat masculinities, women and/in war, heroines and heroes, war and rape, veterans and civilian life, overseas military bases, race and the military, personal and environmental legacies, and representation of war and violence. We examine these concepts in exemplary modern wars, but also draw on legendary military conflicts taking place before the advent of modern weaponry, involving, for example, the Amazons and the samurai. We read journal articles, book sections, letters and diaries, war tales and novels, and watch documentaries, videos, and feature films. Upon successful completion of the course, students should gain an understanding and inquisitiveness about the concept and practice of wars, including: war making involves both men and women whether or not they are combatants; gendered thinking supports the war processes; war-making typically demands certain kinds of ""masculinity"" in fighters of any gender; war affects most combatants' lives forever; the scope and character of victimhood, both human and environmental, is far reaching; and war system implicates sex, race and violence.","Tonomura,Hitomi",HISTORY,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 010," - War, Gender, Masculinity, Violence",4,HU,,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  
Social Science Topics in History,"""In the Middle East, modernity was associated as much to innovative ideas, new technology, and medical improvement as it was with European colonization. Being modern in the Middle East involves in influential and intricate historical transitions from the nineteenth century through to the present. Modernity is manifested in everyday life in Latin-script alphabets and printed languages, redesigned apparel and refashioned demeanors, desirable lifestyles and preferable sensibilities. On a social level, Middle Eastern societies accommodated updated European technologies and reinvented classical practices of transmitting faith and performing religiosity. Politically, the region became disintegrated from the diverse but cohesive Ottoman Empire into more than twenty independent nation states with demarcated political boundaries yet interweaving ethnic groups. This course examines the intersectionality of politics, society, and everyday life in the making of the modern Middle East. It sets forth the multiplicity and diversity of modern visions and practices throughout the region. The course also draws attention to the various forces that shaped modernity's appearance in the Middle East. We start from the stumbled bureaucratic and social reforms of the Ottoman Empire and the Empire's eventual collapse at the conclusion of the World War I. From there, we examine how European colonial powers took advantage of the empire's collapse to insert their modernization schemes, affecting lives of Middle Eastern women and men alike. In the second half of the twentieth century, global independence movements gave birth to post-colonial nation states in the Middle East, in which left-leaning, secular political elites experimented with ambitious models of self-governance, which gave rise to intensive regional conflicts and lasting social ills. The final part of the course will focus on the troubled reinvention of political Islam under the ambivalent legacy of authoritarian regimes. The course is inclusive to undergraduate students with or without a prior knowledge of the modern Middle East. It will focus on the mashriq (eastern) part of the Arab world, as well as Iran and Turkey.""","Li,Xiaoyue",HISTORY,231,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  
History of Medicine in the Western World from the 18th Century to the Present,"""The history of medicine is, in fact, the history of humanity itself, with its ups and downs, its brave aspirations after truth and finality, its pathetic failures. The subject may be treated variously as a pageant, an array of books, a procession of characters, a succession of theories, and exposition of human ineptitude, or the very bone and marrow of cultural history."" —Fielding Garrison, An Introduction to the History of Medicine  In History 234 we shall adopt each of these approaches and more. Birth, life, illness, and death are universal experiences for all of humankind. How do we think about these experiences? Who do we call to attend childbirth? Who do we call to care for the sick and the dying? The answers to these questions have been quite different for different people at different times and in different places. We will consider the perspectives of not only elite healers, but also of typical patients. We will examine the history of ideas and institutions, asking: Who has practiced medicine? How did those practitioners claim legitimacy? How have changes in medical thinking changed the practice of medicine? Sources will include primary and secondary sources readings, artwork, film, literature, and theater. There is no textbook; with the exception of two plays, all readings will be available on Canvas. The course will use specification grading, which is based on quizzes and blog posts.","Howell,Joel D",HISTORY,234,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
The History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict,"History 244, History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, assesses the origins, dynamics, and amazing, chameleon-like persistence of this confrontation. How did Arab-Zionist rivalry begin? Why have neither peace efforts nor wars produced a stable solution? What arguments does each use to justify its position? Where is the conflict headed?  We welcome students who know nothing at all about the conflict as well as those who already have some knowledge. The course considers a variety of views— pro-Palestinian, pro-Israeli, neutral—in sympathetic fashion. It invites dialogue between people of different backgrounds, and presents readings by diverse authors. The goal is not to indoctrinate, not to impose an official narrative, but to have students develop their own perspectives based on informed understandings. This open-ended, sympathetic atmosphere usually makes this course the most popular in the History Department and one of the most popular in the university.  History 244 includes movies and power point pictures. All readings are on-line.

Modern Africa,"This course offers students the tools they need to understand current events in Africa in historical perspective. The issues that define African politics today are shaped by the economic, political and social changes that attended the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Any student of political science, economics, psychology, business or literature who wishes to understand Africa must study its history, for that history sets the stage for the present.  The course will begin by examining how wide-ranging processes—the slave trade, colonial rule, nationalism, independence—transformed the social and political lives of African people. In the middle part of the course we will explore the dynamics of human rights in contemporary Africa, using a detailed study of a recent court trial in Kenya. Toward the end of the semester we'll study a series of current issues—the political crisis in Zimbabwe; the Rwanda genocide; the end of apartheid in South Africa—in relation to longer-term histories.   The core reading will be a set of primary documents dealing with issues addressed in lectures. By the end of the course, students will have learned how to interpret evidence, synthesize disparate sources, and create compelling arguments about the relation between past and present.","Peterson,Derek R",HISTORY,247,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
The Chinese Renaissance:  Cultural Transformations in Eleventh-Century China,"This course offers an introduction to the profound cultural transformations that occurred in China during the eleventh century, a period when China had the largest cities in the world, with bustling night markets, antique shops, restaurants, and theaters. The simultaneous, interrelated developments in economy, technology, philosophy, religion, literature, and painting during this period bear a close resemblance to those of the Italian Renaissance, yet the achievements of the Song dynasty (960-1279) are much less well known than those of Florence, Venice, and Rome. The course provides an overview both of the history of this period and of the study of this period by European and American historians, thereby affording an introduction to the history of the Song dynasty as well as a modest introduction to the study of history as a discipline.

Modern India and South Asia,"The Indian subcontinent was divided into the twentieth century to form the three modern nation-states of South Asia: India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This region, home to a fifth of the world’s population, is critical to an understanding of our world today. This has been especially evident recently because the region has come to occupy a central place in contemporary discussions about the “rise of Asia” and the “war on terror.” Long before these contemporary interests, however, the subcontinent has played an important role in the history of the modern world. This course is an introductory survey of the making of Modern India and South Asia, starting from the eighteenth century, with the decline of the famous Mughal Empire and the establishment of British colonial rule, to the contemporary histories of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. We will throughout the course emphasize the interplay between indigenous and world-historical forces in shaping the economy, society, politics, and cultures of the region. The first half of the course will focus on the impact of British colonialism and of anti-colonial struggles, leading up to the independence and partition of the subcontinent. The focus in the second half of the course will shift to the consolidation of three new nation-states on the subcontinent.","Sinha,Mrinalini",HISTORY,255,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,With permission of instructor.,,,May not be repeated for credit.

The American South,"Martin Luther King, Jr., Hank Williams, and Beyoncé. The Civil War, the Civil Rights Movement, and Confederate monuments. The US South has often been at the center of the major historical and cultural events of the twentieth century and into the present. Culturally, the region has been the birthplace of American music (from blues and country to rock and roll and hip hop), the home of great literature, and the source of various religious, culinary, and other traditions. Politically, the region has been a site of intense conflicts over race, citizenship, and memory. In this course, we will explore the cultures of the South and situate them within a historical context. We will consider the various every day and expressive cultural forms that emerged from segregation and black protests, from working-class life, from Asian and Latin American migrations, from interactions with the rest of the nation, and from numerous other economic, political, and demographic transformations in the twentieth century. With a central interest in the race, we will also consider how the region’s racial and cultural developments have regularly intersected with the ideas and practices of gender, class, ethnicity, and nation. Throughout the semester, two broad questions will regularly guide our readings and conversations: What is the relationship between race and culture in the South? In what ways is the South unique from other regions and in what ways is it emblematic of the larger nation?","Berrey,Stephen",HISTORY,262,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - A History of Race and Culture since Reconstruction,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

This course explores the history of those fields (psychology, psychiatry, and cognitive science) and their impact on American politics, popular culture, and private life. The science and medicine of mind and brain have deeply shaped who we are, what we do, and how we treat others (including people, animals, and machines). This course examines key moments in this history: from the rise of the asylum and phrenology around 1800, through the growth of eugenics and psychoanalysis a century later, to the advent of MRI and artificial intelligence in recent years. By tracing the tools used to study, police, and alter the minds and brains of ordinary Americans, we will work toward a new history of scientific authority in the United States.","Cowles,Henry",HISTORY,265,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Religion in America,"This is a one-term introduction to the study of American religion from colonial times to the present. The emphasis will be on how Americans have practiced their religion in different eras rather than on religion as a set of formal beliefs. We will explore the European roots of American religious forms, the rise of revivalism as a major cultural force in colonial and nineteenth-century America, the commercialization and fragmentation of religious life after the American Revolution, the legal and political history of the doctrine of religious freedom, the place of women in the major religious traditions, the synthesis of African and Christian belief systems in the slave community, the emergence of fundamentalism on the political stage in the twentieth century, and the wide diversity of sectarian beliefs in all eras of American history. Readings will include a variety of first-hand accounts written by people in the past describing their beliefs and practices, legal cases over differing interpretations of the First Amendment, novels and films depicting religious communities, and scholarly analyses of the place of religion in American life.","Borja,Melissa M",HISTORY,270,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
The Civil War Era in U.S. History,"From debates over Confederate statues to battles over immigration, the American Civil War looms larger in our present-day than any other event in this nation’s history. In this survey course, open to majors and non-majors alike, we will explore the transformation of the United States between 1845 and 1877, a period that witnessed a conflict that cost 800,000 lives and a radical reshaping of American society.  From the battlefield to the factory floor, from southern cotton plantations to the halls of Congress, we will the experience and consequences of the bloodiest war in American history and the radical social and economic experiment of Reconstruction. Although we will cover the military campaigns and the great political debates of the era, the focus of this course will be the immense social changes that caused and followed the Civil War. We will study the shifting role of women in American society, the rise of industrial capitalism, and especially the central place of slavery and the meaning of the emancipation of four and a half million men and women. And we will keep an eye on the present because the meaning of the Civil War—like the meaning of American freedom that the war helped define—remains open and contested today.","Spooner,Matthew Patrick",HISTORY,280,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

In this course, students will learn to think critically about technology, science, and medicine and analyze how they have transformed the world in spectacular and mundane ways. We explore questions such as: How has the development of the medical profession shaped debates about inoculation or the AIDS epidemic? How have culture and politics affected the goals and designs of such technologies as guns, washing machines, and electrical systems? How have science, technology, and politics interacted in debates over climate change?

A World History of Happiness: Care of the Self from the Greeks to the Sufis,"This exciting course treats the history of discourses about happiness, focusing especially on four historical episodes. They are ancient Greek philosophy, contemporary positive psychology, Buddhism (and its interpretation in the light of positive psychology), and Sufism. The course seeks to understand what a range of human beings in history have thought happiness consists in, and how they sought to achieve it and will to put these understandings in dialogue with contemporary positive psychology. The course considers not only virtue and positive emotions (affect) but also ethical action and practices of meditation and mindfulness.","Cole,Juan R",HISTORY,291,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Explorations in History,"This course will build on a theoretical understanding of public history, and provide students with hands-on experience and practical skills including: interpreting data, writing for broad audiences, and collaborating across fields. Working closely with the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), we will learn how to build a museum exhibit, from conception to presentation. We'll also learn about the different roles involved in museum, archival, and other public history-related jobs, and how these positions work together and with the public. Students will have the opportunity to learn directly from an archivist at the NASM, and will walk away from the course with a completed public history project to add to their portfolio.  What different types of jobs are involved in creating a public history exhibit? How do these people work together to bring a project to fruition? How are physical materials used to share history with the public? How do public projects engage with stakeholders and the community? We will discuss these questions and more.  Students will primarily work in groups to develop a basic understanding of the teamwork that is necessary in any public history setting.","Collins,Elizabeth",HISTORY,294,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Public HistoryLab: Museums and Exhibits,2,,,,,,May be elected four times for credit.

American Constitutional History,"From the early origins of popular sovereignty to today's struggles over elections and equality, this course investigates constitutional thought and activity in the United States. Beginning with the Revolution, the Constitutional Convention, and ratification, and continuing through the period of slavery, Civil War, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow, we explore the interactions between social movements and legal change. Reaching the twentieth century, we turn to upheavals around territorial expansion, executive power, the New Deal, American Indian status, African American civil rights, wartime civil liberties, women's rights, LGBT Rights, and immigrants' rights. We examine constitutional amendments, Supreme Court cases, and political battles over citizenship and voting rights that have affected how ""the people"" are constituted. The course puts a particular emphasis on students' own interpretation of primary sources, from testimony before the 1871 Congressional hearings on the Ku Klux Klan, to contests reaching the federal courts in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.","Scott,Rebecca J",HISTORY,315,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,"Students should have a good general knowledge of United States History, such as that acquired in HISTORY 260 and 261, or equivalent rigorous high school history courses.",,May not be repeated for credit.

The Origins of Nazism,"Where did the Nazis come from? Was the Weimar Republic bound to fail? Did the Treaty of Versailles or the Great Depression catapult the Nazis into power? What was the role of racism, of Anti-Semitism? How did the regime consolidate itself? What was the role of ordinary people? How do we explain the Holocaust and what kind of war was the Second World War? Grappling with these and more questions, the first half of the course focuses on Germany’s first democracy, the Weimar Republic and its vibrant political culture. In the second half, we study the Nazi regime, how it consolidated its power and remade society based on the concepts of race and struggle. Discussions of race and race-making are crucial throughout the course. In the name of the “racial purity,” the Nazi state moved ruthlessly against Germany’s Jewish population and cleansed German society of all “undesirable” elements. These ideas and practices didn’t originate with the Nazis and they didn’t operate in a geopolitical vacuum. Thinking about Nazi racism and genocide in both its particular specifics and in a larger global historical context is the main goal of this course.","Thurman,Kira",HISTORY,322,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"HU, RE",,,,Taught in English.,May not be repeated for credit.

While trans rights may appear to be a relatively new phenomenon, even a “frontier,” transgender and gender non-conforming people and communities have a long history in American Culture. This course seeks to explore contemporary transgender movements, politics, and identities in historical context. Throughout the course, we will be particularly attentive to the ways that race, class, citizenship, and ability are connected to gender variance, and we will highlight the scholarship and activism of trans people of color.","Larson,Scott",HISTORY,328,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Transgender American Histories,3,HU,,,,,May be elected five times for credit.

Our discussions illuminate the political, cultural, and religious background against which Arab-Jewish relations have developed and transformed. We cultivate a critical appreciation for the historical complexities of the dynamic relations between both parties by examining the different narratives provided by Jews/Israelis and Arabs/Palestinians. Throughout the course, we scrutinize historical sources that describe both conflict and peaceful coexistence in the “Holy Land” and the Middle East.

While Michelle Alexander has labeled this carceral regime “the New Jim Crow,” its historical roots stretch back to the nineteenth century and lie at the intersection of race and law in the modern United States. This course will examine the entwined histories of race and law in the late nineteenth- and the twentieth-century United States and consider how this relationship has shaped the carceral system over time. We will examine major developments in the relationship between race and law since the end of the Civil War, placing the contemporary crisis of criminalization and incarceration in deep historical context. These major developments include the transformation of criminal justice and law enforcement during Reconstruction, systems of convict leasing and prison labor, the role of racism in transforming ideas about criminality in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the roles of criminalization, policing, and incarceration in US colonialism and imperial expansion, the criminalization of social movements and other forms of protest, and the racialization of the Wars on Crime, Drugs, and Terror. Over the course of the term, we will aim to excavate a usable past that can inform and shape current movements for declaration, justice, restoration, and prison abolition.","Krinitsky,Nora",HISTORY,329,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Histories of Race and Law,3,SS,,,,,May be elected five times for credit.  
Poland in the Modern World,"If you want drama and tragedy, then you will certainly get plenty of that in History 331. This course presents the story of Poland, a country that was restored to the map in 1918 after more than a century of foreign occupation, only to fall to a joint attack by Hitler and Stalin in 1939, endure five years at the very deepest circle of the Nazi hell, and then be “liberated” by a Soviet puppet government that ruled with an iron fist for four more decades. Through all this tribulation there were many attempts at liberation and reform, so this course will offer plenty of heroes. But if all you want is a story of good and evil, emancipation and oppression, then you will probably find History 331 disappointing. The real goal of the class will be to get beyond the familiar stories and come to an understanding of what it was like to actually live in Poland during the 20th century. We will focus on the ambiguities and uncertainties, the happiness that persisted in the face of difficult circumstances and the tragedies that invariably accompanied every victory. In a land that experienced rule by Nazism, Communism, and Capitalism, we will have a chance to see what all three systems really meant, not just as ideologies but as lived experiences. The readings for this class will consist mostly of primary sources that will present you with the actual voices of the people who will be studying. This will include memoirs, political documents, audio and video recordings, and more. There will also be a textbook that offers a broad overview of modern Polish history.","Porter-Szucs, Brian  ",HISTORY,331,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Immigration Law: Critical Approaches to Contemporary Issues,"Immigration is one of the most pressing issues in contemporary US politics. This course assists students to develop an informed analysis of the current political debate through investigation of the legislative history of immigration since the middle of the 1960s and the social impact of such reforms. In particular, we analyze the ways that histories of race, gender, sexuality, class and global politics continue to shape the law and politics of immigration. Students become familiar with a range of legal studies methods, history, sociology, jurisprudence, as well as legal history research techniques. They use these resources to analyze the competing claims about immigration in the current moment. Key issues include the security of the border, the treatment of US citizens identified as Muslim and Arab, the illegal immigration “crisis,” the issue of unaccompanied minors and family separation, the movement of high tech workers and jobs across borders, and the treatment of same-sex couples by the immigration system. The course ends with a workshop in partnership with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, which affords students an opportunity to put their research skills to work on asylum cases, here in Michigan.","Hoffnung-Garskof,Jesse E",HISTORY,335,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Latin America: The National Period,"Latin America’s history is tremendously, and increasingly, significant to global politics, culture, and economic trends. Sharing a hemisphere with the United States, Latin Americans have had especially close and complex relationships with their northern neighbor. Yet many in the United States possess only a superficial understanding of the region’s diverse multicultural societies. This course will introduce students to how modern Latin American nations were formed after the region’s independence, focusing especially on how people of diverse ethnic, political, and economic affiliations have struggled to shape their societies ’ politics and cultures over the past two centuries. Lectures and class discussions will consider processes that affect the hemisphere as a whole, then zero in on unique features and experiences of specific nations or regions, with particular attention to Mexico, Central America, the Andean nations, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.

But out of the prolonged struggle to end white supremacist rule also emerged some of the greatest leaders and thinkers of our time.  This course traces the origins of apartheid, its institutionalization in the Republic of South Africa, and the battle to dismantle it in the later-twentieth century. We will examine the political ideology and mythology of white supremacy, and the propagation of racism in law, culture, labor, and education.

"Religion, Magic, and Mystery After Alexander","How did the conquests of Alexander the Great and then the rise of the Roman empire change the religious landscape of the ancient Mediterranean and the Middle East? In a world of new empires and increasing connectivity, what changes came about in ideas and practices that related humans to gods, demons, spirits, and other beings? Could inherited traditions continue unchanged? What new ideas and practices developed? This course takes a broad comparative perspective on religious change and continuity in the centuries from Alexander the Great to the later Roman empire (the ca. 300 BCE to ca. 500 CE). Topics to be examined include cross-cultural interaction and religious syncretism, new sites and social contexts of religion, political theologies, mystery initiations, magical practices, and new understandings of the cosmos and the human condition. Examples will be drawn from contemporary historical evidence for a range of ancient traditions in the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East, including (but not limited to) the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civic and temple-based religions and their alternatives, Christianity, Judaism, Mithraism, Graeco-Egyptian religion, astrology, magic, Hermetism, Gnosticism, and Manichaeism.","Moyer,Ian S",HISTORY,358,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Civil Rights, Vietnam, Women’s Rights, Black Power, Brown Power, and campus activism. Rock ‘n’ Roll, Motown, The Graduate, Woodstock, and Hippies.  The 1960s staged some of the most transformative political and cultural developments in American history. This course examines the 1960s as a series of cultural and political battles in which various groups fought over what it means to be an American. We’ll consider the political battles that were waged from the early days of the civil rights movement to the activism on college campuses to the resignation of Richard Nixon.  We’ll also consider the cultural battles from the youth culture and black culture origins of rock ‘n’ roll to the popularity of the Beatles to the emergence of a counterculture. Along the way, with a focus on race, ethnicity, and gender, we will pay close attention to those who mobilized for social, political, and cultural change and to those who mobilized in defense of the status quo.","Berrey,Stephen",HISTORY,374,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
A History of Witchcraft: The 1692 Salem Trials in Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective,"The Salem Witch Trials, America's most famous witchcraft episode, drew on a long history of witchcraft belief, accusation, and prosecution in Europe and the New World. This course explores the long context of European witchcraft belief from medieval theology to through The Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, and American Horror Story.   Witchcraft raises questions about human society and belief, about fear and responses to fear. Ideas about gendered bodies played out in deadly ways during the time era of witch-burnings. Modern responses to witchcraft range from historical and psychological analysis, to satanic and neo-pagan feminist revivals, to fantasy novels and movies. We will study them all. The topic is fun, and also deeply serious. In our current moment, when politicians claim to be victims of witch hunts, women's bodies are subjects of national debate, and torture is again endorsed, the historical witch-craze offers unsettling parallels.","Kivelson,Valerie Ann",HISTORY,375,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Epidemics: Plagues and Cultures from the Black Death to the Present,"We are in the midst of an alarming pandemic unlike anything we have ever experienced. Covid-19 is a novel viral disease, spreads widely in the community, causes frightening symptoms and has mounted a continuously disturbing death toll now two years into its course. At its inception, government officials downplayed its significance while blaming foreign countries for its perpetration. We adhered resignedly to restrictive population measures, including our own remote learning experience, that deprived us of social interaction, cultural fulfillment, and intellectual vigor. Presently, these restrictions have eased but our behavior remains divided. Some complacent citizens mistrust scientists and perceive their recommendations to mask, socially distance and vaccinate as a breach of their personal liberties, whereas others anguish at the thought that they or their loved ones remain unnecessarily vulnerable. We are unsettled by the uncertainty of the pandemic's trajectory even though biomedicine has yielded effective vaccines and promising therapies in record times. We yearn for the pandemic to subside, if not end, but when could this occur, and after what cost to individuals, society, our economy and livelihood? Covid-19 is unprecedented in our lifetime.  In this course, we look to the past to find deep historical analogues for today's pandemic. Students will explore leprosy and Black Death in medieval times, syphilis from 1492 to today, 1918 Influenza, AIDS in contemporary society, and today's emerging epidemics, including multi-drug resistant microbes (e.g., ""superbugs""), Zika, and Ebola in the DRC. Students will learn to recognize recurring themes that are applicable today—the trope of fear, blaming of the outsider, the growing confidence as well as skepticism in the capacity of scientific medical experts to handle epidemic threats, and the tensions that develop between public health recommendations and personal liberties. Studying past epidemics at key historic moments will provide students with insight into the social, economic and cultural impact of each disease. It will also give them perspective, consolation, and possibly direction as they live through Covid-19 today.","Kazanjian,Powel H",HISTORY,376,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Transnational in scope, this course situates the migration of Asian/Pacific Islanders in the broader history of the U.S.’s relationship with the Pacific world and pays special attention to?how the lives of A/PI Americans have been shaped by global capitalism and labor, imperial expansion, foreign policy, decolonization and self-determination, transnational social movements, and cross-racial politics.?In addition, this course examines how histories of Asian/Pacific Americans have been shaped by, and have simultaneously challenged, regimes based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, and class.","Borja,Melissa M",HISTORY,378,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Black Feminist Thought and Practice,"What is Black Feminism? In this course, we will explore the history of Black women’s gendered and racial politics in the United States and, in particular, how their beliefs and experiences have differed from other groups. How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism. Course readings are drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods with the goal of exposing students to the history of Black Feminist thought and the breadth of Black Feminist scholarship, activism, and methodologies. By the end of the semester, students will be conversant in the major concepts of Black Feminism and Black Women’s Studies and have developed the analytical tools to understand how race, gender, and class interact to produce the unique experiences of Black women in the United States.","Strongman,Saraellen",HISTORY,388,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in European History,"Students examine the German experience of warfare on the level of individual women, men, and children who lived through conflict as combatants, civilians, and bystanders. Personal experiences and perspectives are explored by means of the visual arts, film, literary fiction, memoirs, music, poetry, and personal correspondence. The chronological mold is broken by offering students a range of stopping points along the historical timeline that do not conform to linear sequencing, but instead prioritize the subjects’ intimate, personal experiences of warfare and its consequences. Here the term “German” is broadened to include the German historical imagination’s understanding of the concept when contemplating warfare. Thus students do not merely study those periods of war that one would expect to see in this course—the First and Second World Wars—they might also examine narratives from the victory of the Germanic tribes against the Roman legions in the Battle of Teutoburger Forest, the tribulations and deprivations of the Thirty Years War, and the Wars of Liberation fought against Napoleon. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be placed upon the individual’s experience of warfare and the illumination of periods of German history that might not be well known to the modern student of German.","Mills,Andrew",HISTORY,391,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).  
Topics in Asian History,"""Japan's poor ranking in the 2021 gender gap index, published by the World Economic Forum, has caused embarrassment,"" reports one newspaper, pointing to the ""appalling"" rank of 121 among the 156 nations! In premodern times, things were different. Initially, women were emperors as often as men; elite women had the economic securities alongside men and were the dominant culture-makers, authoring novels still considered the world's greatest. What happened since then? We consider critical factors that influenced the society's gender relations in the long premodern times by investigating gender-specific structural empowerment and impediments, such as the imperial bureaucracy and military violence, and consider the changing norms of male and female behavior toward the body, sexuality, blood, spirituality, militarism, political participation, and economic prerogatives. While the primary target of examination is changing gender relations in Japan, we integrate comparative materials from China and Korea. The three countries shared, for example, the fundamental bureaucratic system of ancient China, yet the value of Confucianism in social practices differed vastly.","Tonomura,Hitomi",HISTORY,392,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Germany and the Black Diaspora,"Taught in conjunction with University College London and the University of Missouri, this course explores global Black histories in an unlikely place: German-speaking Europe. This course is timely, too: as African migrants make the dangerous passage by ship to Europe to plead asylum in Germany and more neo-Nazi hate crimes take place, more public conversations in Central Europe are addressing what it means to have Black people on German lands. But students in this class will learn that people of African descent have always been a part of Central European history. From Black saint iconography in medieval churches to entertainers such as Josephine Baker or Beyoncé in Berlin, Germans have long engaged with and responded to Black figures in European history. In so doing, they have participated in global conversations on nationalism, colonialism, race, and gender. Students in this class will learn to think about Germany’s Black pasts in general and Afro-German history specifically while also developing their skills as digital humanists: together we will use blogs, learn digital mapping technologies, and curate an online digital museum exhibit to think about the humanities in the 21st centuries. Students will also collaborate closely with students at University College London and the University of Missouri on these projects. By working with peers on two continents and on three different campuses, students will engage deeply with questions of national identity, race, culture, and diaspora in the 19th and 20th centuries.","Thurman,Kira",HISTORY,396,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Problems in Roman History,"Growing up is hard. It involves internalizing—or subverting—customs and social expectations, assuming responsibilities, and exposing oneself to new types of danger. It’s also exciting and full of shifting possibilities. This course explores the process of growing up by taking a close look at how people living under the Roman empire saw and experienced the milestones of birth, childhood, adolescence, and the transition to becoming an adult.  Each week will focus on a different aspect of human maturation, moving chronologically through successive stages of growth. We will begin with Greco-Roman theories of conception, followed by topics such as birth, infancy, toys and play, education, puberty, marriage, sex, and reproductive labor. We will study a wide range of ancient texts (in translation), artifacts, and works of contemporary scholarship, asking questions such as: when did Romans believe human life began? How did women protect themselves from the dangers of childbirth? Was there such a thing as ‘childhood’ in Roman culture?","Freidin,Anna Bonnell",HISTORY,402,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Growing up in the Roman World,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Advanced Study in Comparative and Transnational History,"This course examines cases of famine from across the past two centuries. Although famine has long been conceived of as arising from ""natural"" disasters like drought and pest infestations, recent work has suggested that human action may be more at play than had once been thought. In this course, we examine historical cases of famine from the past two centuries to evaluate its causes and responses to it across different parts of the world. How did different societies conceive of and respond to ecological forces, and how did ecological forces change different societies? In examining several cases, we will have the opportunity to evaluate claims about famine's human and/or natural provenance, as well as ideas about famine's relationship to empire-building and state-making. To what extent have waves of hunger and starvation over the past two centuries helped to secure the division between the Global South and Global North? To work through these questions, we will have a combination of lectures, discussions, and group work. Students will be evaluated on attendance, participation, assignments, and exams.","Ghazarian,Matthew",HISTORY,407,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

Twentieth-Century German and European Thought,"German 20th century intellectual history is driven by the dual need to understand the dynamics of modernity and to think a way out of its destructive trajectory. In this course, we will explore crucial episodes of this history: Nietzsche’s and Freud’s analysis of morality and aggression; Wittgenstein’s attempt to reconcile philosophical thought with everyday life; Heidegger’s critique of Western metaphysics; Arendt’s inquiry into the origins of modern totalitarianism; Agamben’s and Foucault’s analyses of biopolitics; Benjamin’s reflections on art and mass culture, and others.

"History, Memory, and Silence in the Middle East","This seminar is an exploration in the anthropological approaches to the study of history and memory. It introduces and problematizes the concept of ‘silence’ in the empty archives, the ruptured oral historical accounts, and the fragments left behind by past events. Taking the demise of the Ottoman Empire as a starting point, the readings probe into the history, historiography, and historicity of minorities, refugees, genocide survivors, as well as undocumented populations and unarchived events to navigate the following questions: How do we trace and represent the past in the aftermath of violence and destruction? How do we conduct research when the evidence is destroyed? What constitutes ‘evidence’ for history? How could we entertain (im)material remnants of the past to rethink our understanding of the ""archive""? The readings are anchored in the ethnography of the Middle East and North Africa, with a comparative reference to the Balkans. We take the Armenian genocide and the politics of its historiography, commemoration, and denial as a case study. This course satisfies the major requirements for History, Anthropology, and Middle East Studies.","Al-Rustom,Hakem Amer",HISTORY,430,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Modern Middle East History,"Starting in December of 2010 a wave of revolutionary demonstrations, protests, civil wars and riots swept across the region that we refer to as the Middle East. From the Tunisian uprising triggered by the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, to the challenges to the neo-liberal policies of the Erdogan regime in Turkey, anti-corruption protests in Lebanon, the call for democratic change in the region has been perceived as an unprecedented awakening of Middle Eastern society. This course instead will look at the long tradition of social protests and dissident movements in the region. Moreover, we will work against conventional wisdom that thinks the region to be culturally predisposed and ""susceptible to irrational political radicalism, authoritarianism, and terrorism."" Instead, this course will highlight the contentious politics of the poor, women, the working classes, dissident youth and intelligentsia, and various forms of Islamism as responses to socio-economic and political problems and constraints within their historical context. We will utilize Social Movement Theory, a popular field of study in European and North American social sciences, to help us understand some of the underlying dynamics of contentious politics in the Middle East, while at the same time challenging its presumed universal applicability. Through case studies from the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, we will ask: What are the variant reasons for people to contest power? How do people mobilize? Why are some movements institutionalized while others are short-lived and transitory? What kinds of media facilitate mobilization? And what might be their meanings in the national, regional and international contexts? The course materials are made up of academic articles, social biographies, memoirs, music, art, and poetry to provide broad social and cultural insights into contentious politics in the Middle East.","Tanielian,Melanie Schulze",HISTORY,443,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in History,"The English Civil War (1642-49) marks a crucial historical transition away from feudal legal and political structures. The violence surrounding this conflict included regicide -- the highly symbolic execution, in 1649, of Charles I -- not to mention notorious massacres in Ireland. After the public trial and beheading of Charles I, monarchy in England would never be the same. Those caught up in this war experienced it as the ending of a known world and the invention of a new one. The world had been turned upside down. We will look at the conflict through a mixture of well-known and less familiar writers. These will include the poets Andrew Marvell and Robert Herrick; the agrarian communist or “True Leveller,” Gerrard Winstanley; the cofounder of the Quakers, Margaret Fell Fox; and three pertinent historians.","Hawes,Clement C",HISTORY,445,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Writing the English Revolution: Rhetoric and Regicide in the Seventeenth Century,3,,,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

"The Icelandic Sagas: Vikings, Women, and Vengeance","
The Icelandic Sagas are unique literary documents from medieval Iceland. They inform us about the cultural, political, and religious currents of land in tumult and transition. Unlike many contemporary texts, these are not inherently moralistic or celebratory  —  instead they are dark, matter-of-fact inquiries into the way individuals respond to often unresolvable situations. In this course, we will encounter vindictive women, treacherous kings, heroes and anti-heroes, lawyers, berserkers, and poets.

Asians in American Film and Television,"This course examines how film and television have reflected and shaped Asian culture and identity in American history. Through screening of feature films, documentaries, and television shows produced by Asian Americans and non-Asians, we study shifting representations of Asians across historical periods from the 19th century to the present. How have the movies and TV shaped American conceptions of Asians? How do images of Asians as “coolies,” “yellow peril,” “dragon ladies,” “gooks,” and “model minorities” circulate in American popular culture? Have Hollywood stars like Bruce Lee, Sandra Oh, Ali Wong, and Hasan Minaj broken down stereotypes or created new ones? How have independent filmmakers generated new and more complicated conceptions of Asian American identity and culture? In this course, you will learn to analyze:? How American wars, hate crimes, immigration policy and Asian American identity have been influenced by racial stereotypes? How images of Asian women and interracial romance have shaped American culture? How the representation of Asian Americans compare to other racial groups Ethnic groups examined include, but are not limited to, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Southeast Asian, Korean, and South Asian Americans.","Lawsin,Emily P",HISTORY,454,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ID, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
The History of Colonial India,"This course explores the histories of imagination, construction, and lived experience that help constitute urban life in South Asia (especially India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh). Temporally, the course will cover the period from British colonial rule in the subcontinent through the present. Our goals will be to explore the breadth of urban arrangements present in modern South Asia; understand how urbanism and architectural modernism in the region helped contribute to a transnational modernity that has often ignored those contributions; and cultivate an awareness of how contemporary urban experience in the region helps challenge some of the durable categories (""global city,"" ""dual city,"" ""smart city,"" etc.) that have been used to analyze Indian (and other) cities in developmental, journalistic, and academic discourse. Using a range of scholarly, fictional, historical, and filmic sources, we will explore such things as: the history of colonial town planning and urban ""improvement"" in relation to contemporary urban form; urban/rural connectivity as both an idea and a concrete relation; the formatting and management of infrastructure, water, and the urban environment; the nexus of real estate, political patronage, and money animating development on India's urban peripheries; and evolving paradigms of non-state urban activism.","Glover,William J",HISTORY,457,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Among other things, we will study modern print media, ranging from poster art to publishing projects such as the magazine USSR in Construction, but also such domains that display distinct visual aspects without necessarily being prime foci of visual culture, e.g., the culture of festivities and visual aspects of the public space. We will also discuss profiles of artists who were active in forging the bridge between the avant-garde and political art (Klucis, Lissitski, Rodchenko). Time permitting, some of these domains will be compared— and contrasted— with similar phenomena in interwar Germany, especially as regards the culture of photo-illustrated magazines and book covers, visual aspects of the public space, or the cult of personality.

That is, we will be dealing with four different German states: the Third Reich, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and the Federal Republic after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the so-called Berlin Republic. We will start in 1943 or the year that many people inside and outside of Nazi Germany considered the beginning of the end of National Socialism. We will frequently return to the following questions: 1) How did politicians, public intellectuals, and artists think about the National Socialist prehistory of the country and its meaning(s) for the present? 2) What does it mean to say that one state ends and another begins? What is the meaning of “new beginnings”? 3) What effect did the Third Reich and the Holocaust have on the way authors and visual artists thought about their work? 4) Which traces did the past leave in cities like Saarbrücken, Vienna, or Berlin, the capital of the Nazi Empire and the newly united East and West German states? Finally, we will read some philosophical and theoretical texts on memory (Nietzsche; Freud).

History Colloquium,"Were they mad or did they lead boringly routine lives—eating lentils, tending gardens, reading, and praying? Why would anyone choose to live on top of a pillar whipped by wind and rain? What is achieved by speaking to others in your house only for a few hours one day a week and for the rest keeping silent? And did Teresa of Avila in ecstasy really levitate above ground, when she was also the woman who rode mules and ate partridges with gusto, founding convents and proving herself a wily business woman? The monastic venture would seem an impossible one: the aspiration to achieve oneness with the divine while grappling with human limitations and frailities. Yet the monks and mystics we will encounter between the fourth and sixteenth centuries CE altered landscapes, created and maintained interregional travel networks, and established communities that have endured into our century. Many also brewed (still brew) the best beer.

Throughout Islamic history, philosophies of peace and conflict resolution have been important parts of this tradition. As in the Bible and in Judaism and Christianity, peace thought and practices have co-existed with ideas about war. With regard to the study of Islam, however, academic scholarship has been one-sided in concentrating on war. This course attempts to address this imbalance through a series of case studies. It surveys ideas of peace the late antique world, in the Qur'an and early Islam, and in medieval Sufism. The course then addresses the age of European empire and Muslim peace movements, from Gandhism to Senegalese Muridism.

History Colloquium,"After reviewing the scope of European expansion into Asia and Africa in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the course introduces the intimate voices and actions of the Europeans on the Japanese archipelago who sought to ""save"" souls, and beat the other rival colonizing forces. Amidst rampant warfare, Japanese samurai were jolted by the arrival of ""Europe."" After a shipwreck ""discovered"" Japan in 1543 and introduced guns, the Portuguese Jesuits followed it with the Bible, a tiger and other goods from Asia and Africa. Camouflaging their sovereign's raw political ambition with evangelism and commerce, the priests admired the samurai's strict rule and decried women's mobility and easy lifestyle, though not as much as did the normalized practice of male-male sex. They astutely studied the Japanese language, expressed Christian God in Buddhist terms, won some converts, and took East Asians as slaves along with those from Africa. The supreme warlord Oda Nobunaga welcomed the Europeans but Hideyoshi, his successor, began an anti-Christian move, while taking his own expansionist urge to invade Korea. By the mid-seventeenth century, Christianity was entirely forbidden on the soil of the Japanese archipelago.   This is a seminar-style course for juniors and seniors. Evaluation is based on in-class participation, report on museum artifacts, comments on films, occasional quizzes, analysis of source materials, such as writings by warriors, Korean officials, and European missionary-traders, and a five-page final paper, or an alternative presentation, such as a website on a focused topic. By taking this course, students will become acquainted with a pattern of global expansion that is often skipped over in Europe-centered courses. They will learn about the clash and confluence of cultures and beliefs, and the first-time awareness of visual ""racial"" differences on the archipelago.

Senior Honors Colloquium,"Senior Honors seminar for thesis writers.
HISTORY 499, the Senior Honors Colloquium, is a year-long writing workshop led by a faculty member which includes all seniors writing Honors theses. Although the thesis is written primarily under the guidance of the faculty advisor, students help one another with projects in the workshop by sharing experiences, advice, interests, and, ultimately, portions of their theses. Completed theses, which must be submitted by April 1, usually range anywhere from 60 to 100 pages.

Honors Core in Social Science,"This course examines violence and its relationship to oil as a non-renewable natural resource. The course will focus on the close examination and comparison of discourses and practices concerned with resource extraction, resource distribution, energy security, and ‘modernity’ in the United States, North America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Emphasis will be on case studies on oil as a non-renewable natural resource and how its extraction has contributed to reshaping livelihoods, energy security and creating spaces of violence as well as the possibilities for ‘development’. The course investigates how oil explorations in postcolonial states have given rise to projects of ‘nation building’, state-making and challenges of governance that continue to confront and reshape the idea of what constitutes the ‘nation’. We will focus on how abundant oil resources have changed the ‘face’ of the state and its people bringing about discourses of power, culture, energy security, and modernity. We will also focus on how extraction of oil constantly produces violence and challenges to state power over its control. We will investigate how such conflicts, sometimes violent, have and continue to redefine state, multinational corporations, and communal production of power in resource extractive enclaves around the world. At the end, we will ask ""what if there is no oil""?","Adunbi,Omolade",HONORS,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Violent Environments: Oil, Development, and the Discourse of Power",4,SS,Honors,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

"Death, Immortality, and Afterlife","“What makes us human?” We may think that it is our ability to use language, or our capacity for abstract thinking, making history, crafting art, and developing religions, or is it our cognitive facility to conceptualize death and immortality? This course aims to answer these questions by resorting to the long and distant past, known as deep history, that spans from the prehistorical to the present. Realizing that this question goes beyond the capacity of any single academic discipline, we turn to history, cultural anthropology, archaeology, palaeontology, developmental psychology, comparative religions, art, and literature to explore the universal human search for the meaning of death and immortality. Cultural practices around death and immortality, like burial and mortuary rituals and telling stories about the afterlife, have marked the human experience since the emergence of homo sapiens. This course maps such practices to probe into the uniqueness of human beings compared to our closest hominid ancestors, especially the Neanderthals, to ask if they also have ritual burials, and if they so, how does this change our definition of being human. We then turn to the beginnings of the religious expression in prehistory leading to the foundations of the world’s major religions. Finally, we end by exploring how present communities imagine, negotiate, and ritualize the deaths of the living and the lives of the dead.","Al-Rustom,Hakem Amer",INTLSTD,209,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in International Studies,"This course is an introduction to the field of global health. We will develop a toolkit of historical and analytical approaches for identifying and managing practical issues that arise in global health interventions. We will then apply these tools to case studies from around the world, using a biosocial model drawing on a range of disciplines (including anthropology, clinical medicine, history, public health, economics, and delivery science). Finally, students will use these analytical methods to construct their own consult-style biosocial analysis of a contemporary global health intervention, both as an educational tool and as a portfolio component for further work in global health or related fields. With attention to historical precedent and a critical sociology of knowledge, we will explore how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in expected and unexpected ways.","Stonington,Scott",INTLSTD,301,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Concepts in Global Health,4,,,,INTLSTD 101.,,May be elected twice for credit.

Latin America: The National Period,"Latin America’s history is tremendously, and increasingly, significant to global politics, culture, and economic trends. Sharing a hemisphere with the United States, Latin Americans have had especially close and complex relationships with their northern neighbor. Yet many in the United States possess only a superficial understanding of the region’s diverse multicultural societies. This course will introduce students to how modern Latin American nations were formed after the region’s independence, focusing especially on how people of diverse ethnic, political, and economic affiliations have struggled to shape their societies ’ politics and cultures over the past two centuries. Lectures and class discussions will consider processes that affect the hemisphere as a whole, then zero in on unique features and experiences of specific nations or regions, with particular attention to Mexico, Central America, the Andean nations, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. Students proficient in Spanish may earn one additional credit by enrolling in the Spanish discussion section (004).

"Chinese Food in Crisis: Health, Ecology, and Identity in an Age of Globalization","The current Chinese diet is nothing like it was fifty years ago. Today, Western influence makes itself felt in the diets of a billion Chinese– evinced by the ubiquity of fast food chains like KFC in urban malls, the milk cartons and sugary drinks downed by school-age children, and pork and beef manufactured through industrial systems of food production. Critics charge that the Westernization of the Chinese diet has contributed to expanding waistlines, skyrocketing rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Experts also blame Westernized cuisine and food production for the destruction of the Chinese environment and the countryside. Food critics blast Westernization for the erosion of a venerable Chinese culinary tradition. But is any of this true? This course will evaluate the impact of dietary Westernization from an interdisciplinary perspective, considering its implications for health, environment, and national identity.

A connecting theme is how racial and ethnic identities, levels of economic development, spirituality, and religion have shaped relationships between people and landscapes. The central goal is to develop an appreciation for both the harmful and the innovative ways that aesthetics, technology, and power shape human-environment relations. Course materials include readings selected from history, geography, anthropology, and architecture, as well as painting, photography, and film. As a result of our interdisciplinary approach, students will learn how landscape design expresses philosophical concepts; be able to critically evaluate the Anthropocene concept; understand how symbolic violence is carried out through the structure of refugee camps; and gain tools for analyzing the intersection of climate, power, and migration.","Uehling,Greta L",INTLSTD,401,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003," - People, Land, and Time",3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

These transgressions create two difficult dynamics for a transitioning society. First, these violations leave populations struggling to coexist with both their former assailants and the state that made such violence possible. Second, the memory of these atrocities often compel some actors to demand that the responsible individuals be held accountable for their actions. Reconciling the two is a difficult process that can contribute to, or undermine, efforts to rebuild. Hence, this course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses, and the political, legal, economic, and moral ramifications of each choice.","Marcum,Anthony Scott",INTLSTD,401,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - Pursuing Accountability: Issues and Conflicts of Justice in Reconstruction,3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

In this class we explore the mouth-watering history and prehistory of how, in Neolithic times, humans made the first genetically modified crops and animals through selection and domestication; how, in the age of empires and globalization, produce were exchanged and traded across continents; and how, in the modern era of cosmopolitan multiculturalism, “Country X-inspired” dishes can earn you praise or ridicule (sorry, Jamie Oliver). We also cover issues of food security, food sovereignty, impact of climate change on food supply, and unequal access to food.

What are the roles of elders in different societies? What are the roles of those who have already died? Ultimately, what aspects of the end of life are universal, and what aspects are socially constructed? In this course, we will delve into the social sciences, the arts, and our own qualitative research projects, seeking insights about the nature of aging, dying and caregiving.

The Qur'an as Utopian Text,"In this course, we read the Qur’an as a great book and as a utopian text. What does it take to create and sustain the ideal community? In its guidelines for living in community and in its words of encouragement and strength for the individual believer, the Qur’an recognizes that creation is always imperfect and always working toward perfection. In this course, we read the Qur’an alongside the writings of (mostly) American Muslim scholars and artists, who interpret the book as a way to think through the pressing social, political and personal issues of the day. We discuss how American Muslims are contributing to the emergence of a new, global interpretation of Islam, able to respond to the social, economic and environmental challenges that face the planet in the 21st century. We read the Qur’an from beginning to end, along with selections from modern scholars that study the Qur’an from the perspective of ecotheology, feminism, and social and racial justice, and literary, artistic and musical works inspired by the Qur’an. We also listen to Qur’anic recitations and look at images of Qur’an manuscripts. For anyone interested in learning more about the Qur'an and emerging American Muslim engagement with the Qur'an.","Mallette,Karla",ISLAM,221,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Immigration Law: Critical Approaches to Contemporary Issues,"Immigration is one of the most pressing issues in contemporary US politics. This course assists students to develop an informed analysis of the current political debate through investigation of the legislative history of immigration since the middle of the 1960s and the social impact of such reforms. In particular, we analyze the ways that histories of race, gender, sexuality, class and global politics continue to shape the law and politics of immigration. Students become familiar with a range of legal studies methods, history, sociology, jurisprudence, as well as legal history research techniques. They use these resources to analyze the competing claims about immigration in the current moment. Key issues include the security of the border, the treatment of US citizens identified as Muslim and Arab, the illegal immigration “crisis,” the issue of unaccompanied minors and family separation, the movement of high tech workers and jobs across borders, and the treatment of same-sex couples by the immigration system. The course ends with a workshop in partnership with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, which affords students an opportunity to put their research skills to work on asylum cases, here in Michigan.","Hoffnung-Garskof,Jesse E",ISLAM,335,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in Islamic Studies,"How has art developed in Palestine since the formation of the state of Israel? How do artists produce work under occupation? How has a notion of Palestinian art developed in a society that lacks statehood and is divided geographically both regionally and in diaspora? This course aims to explore these and related questions through an examination of Palestinian art production from 1948 to the present. Beginning with an overview of Palestinian art prior to 1948, the course then traces Palestinian art production within historic Palestine (present-day Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza) and the diaspora. We will look both chronologically and thematically at how artists have addressed issues such as exile, occupation, diaspora, and resistance over the last 70 years. Students will develop skills in visual analysis, critical thinking, and academic writing. These skills will be honed and demonstrated through group work, in-class participation, quizzes, an in-class presentation, and a final research paper on an artist or work of the student’s choice. No prior knowledge of art history or Palestinian history required.

Humanities Topics in Islamic Studies,"Representations of Muslims that dominate in the West typically present two monolithic images—that of the terrorist and that of the victim (of either Islamist fundamentalism or Western warfare). It is rare that representations of Muslims by Muslims rise to prominence within the West that are not either framed as a “humanizing project” aimed at making Muslims more sympathetic or derided for reaffirming Islamophobic stereotypes in order to appeal to a Western audience. These flawed or incomplete representations can have real-life societal and political consequences—from interpersonal misunderstandings to impacting the formation of legislation and international policy. In this course, we will complicate and critique these depictions of Islam and Muslims by examining representations of Islam by Muslims and individuals from the Islamic world across diverse forms of contemporary cultural expression and consider the impact that more diverse representation can have on a local and global scale.
Readings will include scholarly discussions of representations of Muslims in cultural production and address questions including: How has 9/11 and the rise of the global “war on terror” altered these representations? What is the effect of the conflation of Muslims and individuals from the so-called Islamic World (aka Middle East/Near East/West Asia)? How are cultural producers challenging assumptions about hijabi (veiled) women? How have representations of Islam translated to real-world impacts on a social and political scale? We’ll examine works across media including the visual arts, film, literature, graphic novels, and even video games. Examples of what we’ll be looking at include Sharif Waked’s video To Be Continued, Ayad Akhtar’s play Disgraced, and Marjane Satrapi’s graphic novel Persepolis to name a few.

Modern Middle East History,"Starting in December of 2010 a wave of revolutionary demonstrations, protests, civil wars and riots swept across the region that we refer to as the Middle East. From the Tunisian uprising triggered by the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, to the challenges to the neo-liberal policies of the Erdogan regime in Turkey, anti-corruption protests in Lebanon, the call for democratic change in the region has been perceived as an unprecedented awakening of Middle Eastern society. This course instead will look at the long tradition of social protests and dissident movements in the region. Moreover, we will work against conventional wisdom that thinks the region to be culturally predisposed and ""susceptible to irrational political radicalism, authoritarianism, and terrorism."" Instead, this course will highlight the contentious politics of the poor, women, the working classes, dissident youth and intelligentsia, and various forms of Islamism as responses to socio-economic and political problems and constraints within their historical context. We will utilize Social Movement Theory, a popular field of study in European and North American social sciences, to help us understand some of the underlying dynamics of contentious politics in the Middle East, while at the same time challenging its presumed universal applicability. Through case studies from the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, we will ask: What are the variant reasons for people to contest power? How do people mobilize? Why are some movements institutionalized while others are short-lived and transitory? What kinds of media facilitate mobilization? And what might be their meanings in the national, regional and international contexts? The course materials are made up of academic articles, social biographies, memoirs, music, art, and poetry to provide broad social and cultural insights into contentious politics in the Middle East.","Tanielian,Melanie Schulze",ISLAM,443,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

"Second-Year Italian, Continued","The relevance that colloquial expressions play within daily communication is often underestimated. As a matter of fact, it is not possible to fully understand linguistic, cultural, and social phenomena without taking into consideration to some degree the idiomatic symbols that circumscribe or even exceed the scope of a codified language. Based on these premises, Italian 232 The Cheeky Manual for Street Survival is designed to further develop reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills through the analysis and the comprehension of texts that employ a variety of everyday expressions. In addition to the grammar topics covered by a standard Italian 232 curriculum, the syllabus will recount the evolution of the Italian society beginning in the 1960s by exploring a variety of cultural aspects that are usually neglected because they are accessible exclusively through idiomatic phrases.","Mosciatti,Roberto",ITALIAN,232,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - The Cheeky Manual for Street Survival,4,,Lang Req,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Second-Year Italian, Continued","This course, “Annotating Oral History: A Story of Fascism, Colonialism, WW II, and Identity,” is centered around an interview that is part of the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University. Thanks to the Language Resource Center, we have gained access to this interview. During Winter semester 2021, students in Italian 232 transcribed the interview and during Fall semester 2021, students translated the interview into English. The transcription and the translation help to make the interview available for future generations and researchers. In order to finish our work with this interview, and to contribute to the archive, we will annotate the interview that former students have transcribed and translated. In annotating the interview, we will give context and background information necessary to understand the interview. As such, this course offers students a unique opportunity to work in groups and learn experientially. Additionally, we will contribute to and advance the important work that is being done at Yale to make the stories of men and women who lived during the Holocaust heard. We will be using a video of an interview done at Yale in 1987 of Maria Gilda, a woman who grew up in an Italian community in Tunisia and lived there from the 1920s to the 1960s. After moving away, she became a French citizen and lived the rest of her life in France. This is a 45-minute video in which she tells the story of her life. Through her story, we see a different narrative of war and we can dissect and discuss Maria Gilda’s complex identity as an Italian-Jewish woman who was born in Tunisia and became French. This video will make up the central piece of content in the course in addition to other readings so that we can better understand Maria Gilda’s place and time in history. We will do brief readings/viewings on Fascism, World War II, colonialism, and oral history. Through Maria Gilda’s story we will flesh out the big stakes of history through her point of view. This aspect of history (compared to History with a capital H) will also be the way in which we will enrich our knowledge of the Italian language. In this course we will also have guests come to our class if possible, such as an Italian historian, an archivist, and the family of Maria Gilda. In addition to the content provided by the video and brief excerpts of readings, our focus on grammar will come from the textbook, Immagina. In Maria Gilda’s interview, there is a plethora of grammatical structures at work and in each chapter we will be on the hunt for those structures in the interview and we will use them to describe what we are learning from and about Maria Gilda’s life. The objectives of this course will mirror those of a typical Italian 232 in terms of the advancement of the four skills—reading, writing, speaking and listening. Furthermore, we will dedicate class time to reflectivity, and conversations about culture and history.","Lasker-Ferretti,Janaya S",ITALIAN,232,"Winter 2022, ",Section 009," - A story in history: Fascism, colonialism, oral history and identity",4,,Lang Req,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Language in Action I,"Rome’s ancient glorious heritage, impressive monuments, tasty cuisine and lively streets have always attracted tourists. This class looks at “another” Rome, a chaotic modern city in whose peripheries echo poor, violent and restless voices that shaped how Italians viewed urban identity, contemporary society and their nation. Masterpieces of Italian neorealist cinema (by Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio de Sica, Pier Paolo Pasolini) and Pasolini’s hyper-realist novel, Ragazzi di vita are our first guides through Rome’s back alleys. The second half of the course examines various “margins” of today’s Rome. We will watch movies by Ettore Scala, Gianfranco Rosi, Bernardo Bertolucci, Isotta Toso, Simone Brioni, among others. We will also read Afro-Roman memoirs, like Igiaba Scego’s la mia casa è dove sono, and novels like Ubah Cristina Ali Farah’s Il comandante del fiume.

Modern Italian Studies,"In 2006, Laura Pausini became the first Italian woman to win a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop with her album Escucha. Moving nimbly between Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, Pausini draws attention to a long history of exchanges and connections among the peoples of Italy and Latin America. In this class, we will trace the circulations of people, ideas, and languages between these two spaces, which, despite often being studied as separate spheres, actually share similar trajectories of national formation. Moving from the Italian Risorgimento to our present day, we will follow various figures and texts as they illustrate Italy and Latin America’s common quest for belonging in the so-called modern world. Through a careful selection of materials, we will also recreate the translanguaging between Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese that resulted from the circulation of people and ideas. While the main language of the class will be Italian, both advanced Spanish and Portuguese speakers are welcome to join, as there will be plenty of opportunities to work collaboratively and build our integrated system of communication.

But Ferrante does not build a fantastic universe of wizards, patronuses, and magical trains. On the contrary, the quartet’s portrayal of female friendship, motherhood, and family unfolds against the backdrop of a very distinct and underexplored Italian past. And yet despite being rooted in the particularities of Italian urban life, Ferrante’s saga has become a global phenomenon. What makes it so appealing to audiences all over the world? In this class, we will read all four of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels and discuss its peculiar place (and the place of Italy more broadly) in World Literature. We will pay special attention to how the Neapolitan novels challenge notions of authorship and shine a light on the crucial role of translation in the global circulation of literature.

Basic Musicianship II,"Integral Basic Musicianship (improvisation-based music theory and aural skills

The IBM course is an improvisation-based alternative to conventional music theory and aural skills training designed by UM faculty member Ed Sarath. Second-year students can opt to take the course instead of the regular sophomore theory and aural skills track. The course integrates a trans-stylistic approach to improvisation, composition, keyboard skills, harmony, melody, aural skills, rhythm and analysis within a hands-on format which utilizes resources from diverse musical traditions. Students bring their instruments to class, and they improvise, compose, sing and play all concepts covered at the keyboard as well on their major instruments. Rhythmic training utilizes principles from African, South Indian and Brazilian music. Improvisation is undertaken in jazz, globally-influenced, contemporary classical and figured bass styles. Harmonic training draws from Jazz and European classical music, with keyboard realization as the primary learning vehicle. Students learn to be pianistically 'bilingual'--able to play contemporary jazz/pop chord symbols, and baroque figured bass 'chord changes'. This integration of jazz and classical sources is also central to the writing component of the class, where as an alternative to the four-part chorale context which is central to much theory training, the class uses a keyboard-style written approach which, in fact, is rooted in both baroque and jazz traditions.","Kirschenmann,Mark Steven",JAZZ,221,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,CE,,With permission of instructor.,SEE BULLETIN.,,May be elected twice for credit.

First Year Seminar in Judaic Studies,"While Job's story has exercised Jewish, Christian, and Muslim interpreters over the centuries, it is more than just the biblical book. It is a tradition that antedates the book and one that has been interpreted, retold, and debated from antiquity to the present. Not only has It inspired visual art through the ages, the Joban story has been variously repurposed in contemporary film and dance. Job is amply represented in the world of music as well, from ancient Jewish and Roman chants to punk rock, and hip-hop. All of these contribute to the conversation in Job about why the innocent suffer, whether there is divine complicity in such undeserved suffering, what these may have to say in regard to the nature of such a God, and the responses of the humanity when confronted with terrible injustice. To varying degrees, the interpretations and retellings of Job shape our perception of what is surely one of the most captivating stories, but unsettling enigmas, ever told.","Schmidt,Brian B",JUDAIC,150,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003," - Satan, Sin and Suffering in the Book of Job",3,HU,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

The History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict,"History 244, History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, assesses the origins, dynamics, and amazing, chameleon-like persistence of this confrontation. How did Arab-Zionist rivalry begin? Why have neither peace efforts nor wars produced a stable solution? What arguments does each use to justify its position? Where is the conflict headed?  We welcome students who know nothing at all about the conflict as well as those who already have some knowledge. The course considers a variety of views— pro-Palestinian, pro-Israeli, neutral—in sympathetic fashion. It invites dialogue between people of different backgrounds, and presents readings by diverse authors. The goal is not to indoctrinate, not to impose an official narrative, but to have students develop their own perspectives based on informed understandings. This open-ended, sympathetic atmosphere usually makes this course the most popular in the History Department and one of the most popular in the university.  History 244 includes movies and power point pictures. All readings are on-line. There are no books to buy.","Lieberman,Victor B",JUDAIC,244,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Humanities Topics in Judaism,"This course examines Arab-Jewish relations from the late nineteenth century to present in a contested land--a land known as Israel to some and as Palestine to others. It traces the development of this century-old relationship and how it has been shaped by issues such as subjectivity (who are we), perception (how are we seen), power and powerlessness, immigration, and violent conflict. Our discussions illuminate the political, cultural, and religious background against which Arab-Jewish relations have developed and transformed. We cultivate a critical appreciation for the historical complexities of the dynamic relations between both parties by examining the different narratives provided by Jews/Israelis and Arabs/Palestinians. Throughout the course, we scrutinize historical sources that describe both conflict and peaceful coexistence in the “Holy Land” and the Middle East. Course requirements include weekly comments on the readings, two longer papers, and a final exam. ","Hussein,Mostafa Mahmoud Hassan",JUDAIC,318,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Jews and Arabs in the Holy Land,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

But Jews have spoken many other languages as well, including Hebrew, Aramaic, and Jewish versions of Arabic, Italian, and Spanish. As one historian put it, “one language was never enough for the Jews.” In this class, we will explore the fascinating role of languages in Jewish culture and history. Analyzing diverse materials from Passover Haggadahs to popular Netflix shows  Unorthodox  and  Shtisel, students will learn how, when, and why Jews have used different languages. Among our topics will be code-switching and the role of languages in ideological debates about topics such as Zionism, religion, and Holocaust memory.

Humanities Topics in Judaism,"Race is a social construct. In this course, students will be asked to go beyond this accurate, yet inadequate statement to ask precisely how, why, and by whom race was/is socially constructed. Focusing primarily on French imperial and ‘post’-imperial contexts, we will attend to how race intersects with other social categories such as class, gender, sexuality, and religion within an overarching logic of coloniality to produce and maintain the unequal hierarchies that underpin labor exploitation and land and resource expropriation at local, national, and international levels. In doing so, this course will introduce students to a range of writing on race and coloniality, from Critical Race Theory and Critical Muslim Studies to postcolonial studies and decolonial thought to help us collectively envision antiracist and decolonial futures.","Bharat, Adi Saleem  ",JUDAIC,318,"Winter 2022, ",Section 006," - Race, Religion, and Coloniality",3,"RE, HU",,With permission of instructor.,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Humanities Topics in Judaism,"Where did the Nazis come from? Was the Weimar Republic bound to fail? Did the Treaty of Versailles or the Great Depression catapult the Nazis into power? What was the role of racism, of Anti-Semitism? How did the regime consolidate itself? What was the role of ordinary people? How do we explain the Holocaust and what kind of war was the Second World War? Grappling with these and more questions, the first half of the course focuses on Germany’s first democracy, the Weimar Republic and its vibrant political culture. In the second half, we study the Nazi regime, how it consolidated its power and remade society based on the concepts of race and struggle. Discussions of race and race-making are crucial throughout the course. In the name of the “racial purity,” the Nazi state moved ruthlessly against Germany’s Jewish population and cleansed German society of all “undesirable” elements. These ideas and practices didn’t originate with the Nazis and they didn’t operate in a geopolitical vacuum. Thinking about Nazi racism and genocide in both its particular specifics and in a larger global historical context is the main goal of this course.","Thurman,Kira",JUDAIC,318,"Winter 2022, ",Section 007, - The Origins of Nazism,4,"RE, HU",,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

It tells the story and legacy of the Diary in a country that lost around 75% of its Jewish population in the Holocaust, the highest percentage by far in occupied Western Europe. The course looks to Dutch history and society, and especially histories of segregation and racism, to explain the devastating number, to examine its effects, and to ask how we can recognize and combat racism and persecution today. Significant links are made to anti-Black racism in the Netherlands and the US. Topics include Jewish migration, Jewish Amsterdam, antisemitism and colonial racism, bystanding versus rescue, Holocaust denial, and the fictionalization and appropriation of Anne Frank.

We will also explore the politics of archaeology—how nationalism and geopolitics affect our reconstruction of the past. In addition, we will discuss how knowledge of archaeology can enrich our understanding of the Bible and other texts from the ancient world, and we will explore the limits of archaeology as a discipline. Chronologically, the course covers a period of approximately a thousand years from the Late Bronze Age (1550 BCE) through the early Achaemenid Period (500 BCE).

Rocks, the geological wonders of the volcanic island, are now codified into a number of national and UNESCO park lands that foster stunning biodiversity. The winds that have made life harsh on Jeju are being harnessed for energy, as the island aims to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Women, particularly the free-diving fisherwomen known as haenyeo (sea women), typify Jeju’s distinct island culture and community spirit. Jeju’s idiosyncratic charm forms much of its international appeal, but is the commodification of Jeju helping to preserve its environment and culture, or simply packaging them for palatable consumption?

Immigration Law: Critical Approaches to Contemporary Issues,"Immigration is one of the most pressing issues in contemporary US politics. This course assists students to develop an informed analysis of the current political debate through investigation of the legislative history of immigration since the middle of the 1960s and the social impact of such reforms. In particular, we analyze the ways that histories of race, gender, sexuality, class and global politics continue to shape the law and politics of immigration. Students become familiar with a range of legal studies methods, history, sociology, jurisprudence, as well as legal history research techniques. They use these resources to analyze the competing claims about immigration in the current moment. Key issues include the security of the border, the treatment of US citizens identified as Muslim and Arab, the illegal immigration “crisis,” the issue of unaccompanied minors and family separation, the movement of high tech workers and jobs across borders, and the treatment of same-sex couples by the immigration system.

First Year Seminar (Humanities),"Indigenous languages around the world -- like Eyak in Alaska, Bandjigali in Australia, Ngong in Africa or Saami in Europe -- are disappearing. SIL International reports that in the last five years nearly 100 languages have ceased to be spoken, with over 400 having gone “dormant” or “extinct” since the 1950’s. Yet endangered languages are not the only varieties in crisis; minority languages, dialects, heritage languages or any non-government, non-national language faces erasure. This course explores a range of language crises around the globe, asking what causes a language to no longer be spoken or used. In response, we focus on the social and political contexts that set the stage for crisis, define how a crisis is recognized, and situate how the language crisis is addressed.","Meek,Barbra A",LING,102,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Languages in Crisis,3,HU,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.

We review the shift away from seeing speech behavior or ""languages"" as the object of inquiry to the experimental and theoretical study of the cognitive mechanisms underlying our unique human capacity for language, the exercise of which permeates virtually every aspect of human life, including what you are now doing! In every household, all of the children, barring pathology - but none of the dogs, cats or other organisms (nor the inanimate objects!) - acquire the language spoken or signed by the adults. There is some biological property of humans that makes this feat possible.

Language in Society,"This course introduces linguistic anthropology, the study of language in comparative social and cultural context.  Some of the questions we address include, What is ""language,"" and why do anthropologists study it?  How and to what extent does speaking a particular language construct a culturally specific model of the social and natural world, a sense of 'reality'?  How do our linguistic perceptions influence the ways we recognize social differences, such as those based on ethnicity, race, class, and gender?  How do linguistic practices and perceptions of language reinforce social divisions and relationships of unequal power? 
In pursuing these questions, we cover a range of topics related to understanding how linguistic practices contribute to the social construction of racial and ethnic identity, as well as discrimination based on these perceived differences.  We consider, for instance, how judgments about ""grammatical"" and ""ungrammatical"" or ""educated"" and ""uneducated"" speech are ultimately grounded in social rather than linguistic factors.  Throughout the course we use examples and case studies from the United States and throughout the world.","Meek,Barbra A",LING,272,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Words Matter,4,"SS, RE",,,Primarily for first- and second-year students.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Sound Patterns,"This course explores two fundamental aspects of the sounds of human languages: speech sounds as physical entities (phonetics) and as part of a linguistic system (phonology). In viewing sounds as physical elements, the focus is on articulatory and acoustic descriptions: How are speech sounds made? What types of articulatory movements and configurations are used in the world's languages? What are the acoustic properties of consonants and vowels? In this part of the course, the goal is to learn to understand, describe, and transcribe many of the sounds known to occur in human languages. In addition, we shall learn to measure and analyze acoustic properties of consonants and vowels and examine how they vary in context.","Duanmu,San",LING,313,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, SS",,,"LING 111, 209, 210, or 212.",,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to Syntax,"This course investigates the syntax (sentence structure properties) of human language. It addresses the need for a scientific model to explain human knowledge of the language that also makes predictions about its representation in the mind. The focus here is on human language as a specific cognitive capacity restricted to humans, rather than on the individual languages (e.g., English, Arabic, Hindi) that are made possible by the existence of this capacity. For this reason, the course explores in detail many structural properties that are common across different languages, even those that clearly do not share a common recent past. A simple example: all languages have specific strategies to ask questions that make them different from affirmative sentences (e.g., English uses special question words — ‘who’, ‘what’ and so on — as most languages do). In order to explain this and many other common properties of human language, a scientific hypothesis that has been explored in depth is that a large part of human knowledge of the language is biologically determined and maybe innate. This is further supported by the fact that normal children effortlessly learn their native language at an amazing speed, despite the complexity of the task at hand (compare trying to learn for example Korean or Turkish as an adult, with years of language classes), and despite variation and deficiencies of the language input they are exposed to.","Baptista,Marlyse",LING,315,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,"LING 111, 209, or 210.",,May not be repeated for credit.
Aspects of Meaning,"What do you know when you know the meaning of a word, a phrase, or a sentence? This introductory course aims to answer this question through the study of truth-conditional semantics and (to a lesser extent) pragmatics. The course will take a compositional approach to the representation of linguistic meaning, by investigating the ways that humans are able to predict the meaning of novel phrases and sentences based on the meanings of their parts (words and morphemes) and the ways in which they combine (morphology and syntax). We will also explore the ways in which these meanings relate to the world (or possible worlds), to human cognition, and to conversational context. Our analysis of natural language will make use of a variety of formal tools, including predicate logic, set theory, and functions, which will help us to describe and better understand a variety of empirical phenomena.","Levinson,Lisa",LING,316,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,"LING 111, 209, 210, or 212.",,May not be repeated for credit.

This course provides a basic understanding of the major syntactic phenomena exhibited in Arabic, using Generative syntactic theory, and the formal tools to analyze those phenomena as well as to express theoretical claims and counter claims. Syntactic phenomena covered include: basic Arabic phrase and clause structures, Arabic subject positions, Arabic sentential agreement, Arabic sentential negation, Arabic wh-interrogation structures, and Arabic pro drop/null subject parameter.","Hannouchi,Said",LING,433,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Face-to-Face Interaction,"How do we actually communicate when we talk or type? Whether we are face to face, online, or on the phone, we are not always aware of how we interact. In this introduction to the study of face-to-face communication, we explore the hidden dynamics of the conversation by examining video recordings and transcripts of talk. Although you’ll read literature every week, the course is hands-on and designed to sharpen your skills in observation and analysis. For much of the semester, you’ll use multimedia software to look at different things on the same short stretch of video data, which you record yourself or capture from online sources. You’ll learn to detect and make sense of subtle communicative behaviors, such as pauses, interruptions, vocalizations like uh-huh, and repetition. We’ll look at embodied aspects of communication like gesture, as well as forms of digital interaction, and, more broadly, we’ll consider how interaction matters for big social issues like gender politics, democracy, and religious difference.","Lempert,Michael Paul",LING,471,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in Linguistics,"Prosody refers to the structure of the utterance encoding rhythm, phrasing, and prominence. We start with the examination of the structural and phonetic properties of prosody, focusing on theories of prosodic hierarchies and the manifestations of prosodic structure in acoustics and articulation. We also introduce prosodic transcription. After that, we will select a few topics of interest to the participants of the course (e.g., prosody in speech planning, prosody in turn-taking, prosody in autism, prosody and speech accompanying gestures, the relationship between prosody and emotion, prosody and speech technology, ….). Throughout the course we will pay particular attention to how meaningful research questions can be formulated and how experiments can be designed to answer them.","Krivokapic,Jelena",LING,492,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Topics in Prosody,3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 18 credit(s).

The Honors ThesisStudents may elect LING 495 and 496 when writing the honors thesis, but are not required to do so.
The highlight of the honors concentration is the honors thesis, which reports on original research conducted under the supervision of a Linguistics faculty member. Students select their own thesis advisor, based on their specific research interests. Many students are introduced to faculty's research specializations through coursework, but further information is also available on faculty webpages.

Once a faculty member has agreed to serve as thesis advisor, student and advisor work closely together to identify a thesis topic of mutual interest. Students should begin this process in their junior year; especially if the thesis involves experimentation or conducting surveys, it is often necessary to spend time in the summer months organizing what needs to be done in order to complete the project on time. Ideally prior to the end of their junior year, honors students should fill out the Linguistics Thesis Declaration; students also declare an Honors Concentration in Linguistics with the College of LSA Honors Office. 

Honors theses by students graduating in Winter term commencement are due on April 1, and otherwise are due one month before the date of commencement. The thesis is read and evaluated independently by the thesis advisor and by a second reader jointly selected by the student and advisor. Students completing a double concentration may seek Linguistics honors with or without honors in their other concentration (or vice versa). Double majors who select joint honors may choose to write a single thesis under the supervision of a joint honors committee, consisting of the thesis advisors from both programs. (It is the responsibility of the student to establish the joint committee.) In this case, the advisor from the other concentration serves as the second reader.

All honors thesis submitted in a given academic year are eligible to compete for the Matt Alexander Award, awarded for the best honors thesis in Linguistics at that year's Graduates Reception during commencement weekend.",,LING,496,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,1 - 3,,"Honors, Independent",With permission of instructor.,LING 495.,"F, W, Sp/Su, Su.",May not be repeated for credit.
Capstone Seminar,"This capstone course covers the biological foundations of language (first defined by Eric Lenneberg in the 1960’s), and theories about how language originated and evolved. Before spring break we will consider how biological processes, pathologies, and the physical and cultural environment affect languages, and whether biological models of adaptation and speciation will work for linguistics. We will step back and review how history was integrated (or not) into geology, biology, anthropology, and linguistics over the last few centuries. After the break we will turn to wildly different theories of how human language originated. Who is right: phoneticians who emphasize the geologically slow evolution of the articulatory and auditory systems, syntacticians who argue for an abrupt origin, other syntacticians who argue for a three-stage progression, or ethologists who emphasize the mediating role of manual signs? Are bird calls the key to unlocking the secret? Or maybe Neandertals? ","Heath,Jeffrey G",LING,497,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Biology and Evolution of Language,3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Phonology,"Phonology is the study of the sound systems of human languages. In this course we shall focus on fundamental issues in phonology. We shall discuss evidence for dividing speech into sound segments (consonants and vowels), evidence for further dividing consonants and vowels into features, how consonants and vowels are organized into syllables, how stress is distributed in words and phrases, and other structures above the segment level. We shall discuss unresolved problems in each area, review various proposals, and discuss how to interpret and make use of (large amount of) phonological data, and how to construct an argument or a theory. The course also aims to foster problem-solving skills and critical thinking.","Duanmu,San",LING,513,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,LING 313.,W.,May not be repeated for credit.
Semantics and Pragmatics,"This course serves as an introduction to truth-conditional semantics  — the study of meaning in language using formal methods.  Truth-conditional theories rely on native-speaker intuitions about what conditions must hold in the world in order to make a given sentence true or false. For instance, the sentence in (1) is true in a range of scenarios — e.g., John might own Great Danes or dachshunds – and false in a range of scenarios — e.g., he might own no dogs or just a single Pekingese. These various scenarios comprise its truth conditions.","Keshet, Ezra  ",LING,516,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,Permission of instructor.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Principles and Methods of Historical Linguistics,"This course is about how languages change, what these changes tell us about the nature of language, and how historical linguistics (in combination with archeology and molecular genetics) is used to reconstruct ancient demographic and cultural patterns. Topics include: the traditional comparative method versus recent computational techniques, grammaticalization, how disruptions to morphosyntactic systems (due to sound changes or to language shift) are repaired, how ordinary language contact compares to pidgin and creole formation, whether cross-linguistic typology is a useful guide to historical reconstruction, and how historical linguists identify locations and reconstruct cultural features of ancient populations. A broader issue is how diachronic processes relate to synchronic description.","Heath,Jeffrey G",LING,517,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,"Graduate standing, or permission of instructor.",,May not be repeated for credit.

What is Writing?,"In Storytelling for Social Justice, Lee Anne Bell writes, “The diverse groups that make up the United States provide a rich source of stories to draw upon, but in a deeply racialized society stained by structural racism, not all stories are equally acknowledged, valued, or affirmed…Some stories are supported by the power structure, while others must fight tenaciously to be heard.” Bell's words imply two meanings of “telling stories”: by telling and being open to many different stories we can expand our understanding of what it means to live in this country; but also, stories themselves “tell” or reveal a deeper understanding of how power shapes narratives around race. In this course on writing and rhetoric you will examine an array of stories that shed light on race and ethnicity, applying a set of critical perspectives to look beyond the surface of the stories apparent in all sorts of texts, including film, television, speeches, fiction, poetry, photographs, art, comedy, and music. Writing for this class includes a personal journal in which you track your responses and the development of your ideas, an end of semester reflection, and three papers examining the ways different stories “tell” us something about which “stories are supported,” and why and how others “must fight tenaciously to be heard.”","Beal,Scott W",LSWA,228,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Telling Stories: The Rhetoric and Representation of Race and Ethnicity,3,"HU, RE",,,Completion of the First-Year Writing Requirement.

Writing and Arts II,"The great Marianne Moore famously described success in art as the ability to present “imaginary gardens with real toads in them.” This course is about collaborative worldbuilding and fantasy storytelling, about imagining new realms and bringing powerful stories to life in them. We will explore what makes fantasy “fantasy” and what relationship it has to our lives: as escape from our despair, as complex mirror of our world, and as alternative vision of what’s possible. We will approach these questions from the point of view of both literature and tabletop roleplaying games.  We will study novels, stories, and essays by fantasy authors such as Ursula Le Guin, Saladin Ahmed, and N. K. Jemisin, and we will try several techniques for building fantasy stories from the ground up, including through games like The Quiet Year and Dungeons & Dragons.  Assigned work will include written reflections on course readings; practice worldbuilding tasks from brainstorming to mapping to roleplaying; and a final project involving a short story or one-shot adventure set in your own original fantasy setting.","Beal,Scott W",LSWA,230,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002,,3,CE,,,Participants in the Lloyd Scholars for Writing and the Arts Program.

Mathematics of Data,"This course is open to graduate students and upper-level undergraduates in applied mathematics, bioinformatics, statistics, and engineering, who are interested in learning from data. Students with other backgrounds such as life sciences are also welcome, provided they have maturity in mathematics. The mathematical content in this course will be linear algebra, multilinear algebra, dynamical systems, and information theory. This content is required to understand some common algorithms in data science. I will start with a very basic introduction to data representation as vectors, matrices, and tensors. Then I will teach geometric methods for dimension reduction, also known as manifold learning (e.g. diffusion maps, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), etc.), and topological data reduction (introduction to computational homology groups, etc.). I will bring an application-based approach to spectral graph theory, addressing the combinatorial meaning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their associated graph matrices and extensions to hypergraphs via tensors. I will also provide an introduction to the application of dynamical systems theory to data including dynamic mode decomposition. Real data examples will be given where possible and I will work with you write code implementing these algorithms to solve these problems. The methods discussed in this class are shown primarily for biological data, but are useful in handling data across many fields. A course features several guest lectures from industry and government.

Neuroepigenetics,"

Have you ever wondered how life experiences are translated into changes in the DNA and how these in turn affect behavior? Most of us know that a genome is the blueprint used to build and maintain an organism. While genomes are in fact hidden inside cells, they are also influenced by the “experience” of cells and organisms. These experiences, which come in the many forms, from diet to pollutants to stress, alter the chemical nature of the genome, and in turn, its function. This is particularly crucial in the brain, as its function is linked to behavior.
This class will cross the lines between neuroscience, molecular biology and epigenetics to uncover the effect of the environment and life experience on brain function and behavior. We will first examine how genes determine complex behaviors, and then analyze in depth how ancestral dietary stress, maternal behavior, social stress, and more, affect gene expression to contribute to brain function and dysfunction.Course Requirements:This course involves critical reading and class discussion of recently published research articles in the field of neuroepigenetics.
Assessments will include class interactions, quizzes and a final project where students will be asked to write an essay for the public and record a podcast on a topic related to those covered in class.

"Later Medieval Europe, 1000-1500","In the year 1000, Europe was a rural backwater, barely able to feed its growing population, and riven with the violence of competing warlords. By 1500, Europeans were crossing the Atlantic Ocean, trading directly with China, and powerful king's ruled large territories unified by law. This course looks at how Europe emerged from the margins of the world's stage in this period by examining events like the Crusades, the Black Death, and the invention of the printing press, the rise of institutions like monarchies, the Church, and human bondage, and by looking at long term changes to the medieval climate. We will also ask, who belonged to this emerging world and who was steadily excluded? Where did the idea of nations come from? And we will ask, what is the relationship between the real Middle Ages and the fantasy one that fills video games, white-supremacist politics, and the news media?","French,Katherine L",MEMS,211,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,W.,May not be repeated for credit.

The Miraculous and the Diabolical in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe,"In this course we will investigate 'supernatural' phenomena in the visual arts: divine acts, miracles, magic, and sorcery. We will be interested in how and why people in late medieval and early modern Europe distinguished between the 'supernatural' and the 'natural', as well as the extreme fluidity of these terms. We will investigate how certain 'supernatural' occurrences were considered to have been caused by God, saints, and holy men and women, while others were said to be the work of the devil, demons, sorcerers, witches, and tricksters. A variety of artistic media and genres will be studied: narrative paintings, prints, miraculous images, votive objects, relics and reliquaries, incantations, and prayers. We will also be interested in how conceptions about the miraculous and diabolical were applied to artists and to works of art: the 'divine' Michelangelo was compared to the supreme animator, God; figures of devils in paintings were defaced in order to prevent evil forces from acting through the images. Our inquiry will extend beyond the boundaries of Europe and consider modern day experiences for comparative purposes. Assignments include two reading response papers (4 pages), a mid-term exam and a final exam.","Holmes,Megan L",MEMS,355,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

The History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict,"History 244, History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, assesses the origins, dynamics, and amazing, chameleon-like persistence of this confrontation. How did Arab-Zionist rivalry begin? Why have neither peace efforts nor wars produced a stable solution? What arguments does each use to justify its position? Where is the conflict headed?  We welcome students who know nothing at all about the conflict as well as those who already have some knowledge. The course considers a variety of views— pro-Palestinian, pro-Israeli, neutral—in sympathetic fashion. It invites dialogue between people of different backgrounds, and presents readings by diverse authors. The goal is not to indoctrinate, not to impose an official narrative, but to have students develop their own perspectives based on informed understandings.

Web Based Mentorship:  Learning Through Character Play,"Overview
This seminar revolves around Place Out Of Time (POOT), a web-based character-playing
simulation involving college, high school, and middle school students. You will have a
dual role in the simulation: you will play a character yourself, and you will also act as a
project leader and mentor to the younger participants.

POOT is run in cooperation with the Center for Middle Eastern and North African
Studies and the School of Education at UM-Flint. The core of the simulation is anchored
in the years 711 through 1492 and the cultures in and around what was known as Muslim
Spain, or “al-andalus.” However, the simulation draws from all periods of history and all
world cultures. The simulation revolves around a trial - different each time the simulation
is run -- based on events and people from history. While the details are everchanging,
timeless and universal themes, such as ""identity,"" ""freedom,"" and ""security,""
are the backdrop for POOT.

This class is different because you are responsible not just for your own learning, but for
the learning of younger peers who are depending on you. In order to fulfill that
responsibility, though, you will (collectively) need to understand and articulate a variety
of cultural and historical perspectives, as filtered through the personalities that appear in
the simulation. We have chosen to utilize character-playing simulation for two reasons.
First, we see great value in character playing as an exercise of the imagination. Being
forced to “walk in the shoes” of another, and to consider the ideas and the perspective of
someone from another time or place, can be a powerful catalyst to learning. Secondly,
both you and the student participants will be asked to do this character playing in a taskoriented
way. Mentors and students will learn about their character’s lives, their points of 
view, and the societal contexts in which their characters lived. You will then be
presented with a contemporary problem, which you will consider from the perspective of
your character. The idea is to help the students to construct a bridge between historical
times and the present day, to gain a heightened appreciation for other worldviews, and to wrestle with some (hopefully) interesting questions in a way that will deepen our learning
about history…and about ourselves.
It is often said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. To that, one might add
that the next best way to learn something is to play a game with it. This class tries to
combine both of those methods.","Stanzler, Jeff  ",MENAS,462,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,Experiential,,,,May be repeated for credit.
Web Based Mentorship:  Learning Through Character Play,"Students serve as teaching mentors for a web-based character-playing simulation involving high school and middle school students on a worldwide network, and they themselves also research and portray historical figures. The Place Out of Time simulated trial is different every term, but mentors and students are always presented with a contemporary problem that they must think through in the role of their characters, one that frames an array of social, political, cultural and moral question. Mentors are active participants in a dynamic, writing-intensive enterprise that is aimed at enlivening the study of history through juxtaposing historical perspective and sensibilities. The course employs purposeful ""play"" to frame a hands-on teaching experience that is supported by extensive in-class and written reflective work.","Stanzler, Jeff  ",MENAS,462,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002,,1 - 3,,Experiential,,,,May be repeated for credit.
Web Based Mentorship:  Arab-Israeli Conflict Simulation,"This class is based on a computer-mediated simulation that engages middle school and high school students in exploring the Arab-Israeli Conflict through participating in it themselves. Students in high schools in Michigan, elsewhere in the US, and even outside the U.S. could be interacting with one another, and with you, over the course of the term. University student ""mentors"" (that's you) facilitate this diplomatic simulation (in which we create a scenario that becomes the ""reality"" of our world) and serve as gatekeepers, pushing the students to act in ways that are in keeping with the beliefs/constraints that the person they are portraying would hold and operate under. There is a complex structure in place for them to communicate with others, to issue press releases and otherwise express their interests and trade influence, and finally to introduce possible new actions into the simulated world. All of this is done with the support and with the assistance of the mentors.
    
    Fundamentally, the exercise is an attempt to give students a tangible window into the diplomatic process, with it's slow, thorny inner-workings. This course, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (AIC) simulation itself, are based on the idea that the most meaningful learning often happens when one is actively engaged in a purposeful activity. By participating in AIC as a mentor, we hope that you will get a chance to think deeply about (among other things) how people learn to take diverse perspectives, what it takes to foster thoughtful discourse, and the nature of diplomacy itself.
    
    AIC is also a project in the School of Education, and part of its purpose is to develop new ways that technology can support meaningful learning experiences with high school students. Within the context of the seminar, then, we start with a basic grounding in the history of the conflict, and then move on to figuring out how to let that grounding inform your ongoing efforts to both support and challenge the student participants.

"Islamic Creatures: Animals, Jinn, Monsters, and Angels","What makes a human, and what is the place of humanity within the broader scheme of things? American society in the twenty-first century has seen a surge of interest in topics that raise these questions from various angles: environmental justice, eco-criticism, post-humanism, animal and cyborg studies, and the occult sciences, to name but a few. These conversations tie our present moment not only to its local past (the Hippies of the 1960s, the Transcendentalists of the 1830s), but to other world traditions that question 'human' as a self-sufficient or self-justified category. Islam—or more precisely, the heritage of artistic and intellectual work produced by Muslims of every background and persuasion—brings a rich array of paradigms and perspectives in the ongoing project of thinking 'beyond human.'","Cross,Cameron",MIDEAST,204,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Islam in History,"This course examines Islam as a theological, legal, philosophical, cultural, and artistic tradition as well as a social-political theory and devotional practice. After discussing in detail the formative period of Islamic political and social history, we will review the development of Islam’s foundational ideas in theology, political theory, legal theory and practice, science, culture, art, philosophy, and mysticism from the Middle Ages up to the present. We will pay special attention to the astounding variety of interpretations of Islam by its followers, especially ones, such as Twelver Shi‘ism and Isma‘ilism, that are usually neglected in favor of so-called “mainstream Sunni Islam.” Various expressions of Sunnism will also receive their fair share of attention.

The Qur'an as Utopian Text,"In this course, we read the Qur’an as a great book and as a utopian text. What does it take to create and sustain the ideal community? In its guidelines for living in community and in its words of encouragement and strength for the individual believer, the Qur’an recognizes that creation is always imperfect and always working toward perfection. In this course, we read the Qur’an alongside the writings of (mostly) American Muslim scholars and artists, who interpret the book as a way to think through the pressing social, political and personal issues of the day. We discuss how American Muslims are contributing to the emergence of a new, global interpretation of Islam, able to respond to the social, economic and environmental challenges that face the planet in the 21st century. We read the Qur’an from beginning to end, along with selections from modern scholars that study the Qur’an from the perspective of ecotheology, feminism, and social and racial justice, and literary, artistic and musical works inspired by the Qur’an. We also listen to Qur’anic recitations and look at images of Qur’an manuscripts. For anyone interested in learning more about the Qur'an and emerging American Muslim engagement with the Qur'an.","Mallette,Karla",MIDEAST,221,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

The History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict,"History 244, History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, assesses the origins, dynamics, and amazing, chameleon-like persistence of this confrontation. How did Arab-Zionist rivalry begin? Why have neither peace efforts nor wars produced a stable solution? What arguments does each use to justify its position? Where is the conflict headed?  We welcome students who know nothing at all about the conflict as well as those who already have some knowledge. The course considers a variety of views— pro-Palestinian, pro-Israeli, neutral—in sympathetic fashion. It invites dialogue between people of different backgrounds, and presents readings by diverse authors. The goal is not to indoctrinate, not to impose an official narrative, but to have students develop their own perspectives based on informed understandings. This open-ended, sympathetic atmosphere usually makes this course the most popular in the History Department and one of the most popular in the university.

In October 2021, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, chaired by crown-prince Mohammad bin Salman, led an ownership takeover of the English Premier League Football Club Newcastle United. Saudi Arabia is the third oil-rich state to invest heavily in major soccer teams, following the Abu Dhabi United Group (United Arab Emirates) ownership of Manchester City Football Club and the Qatar Sports Investments group ownership of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. These three Gulf states with questionable human rights records have been accused of sportswashing — using the popularity of football and sports to build positive worldwide reputations. From board games played by pharaohs, kings, and queens found in ancient tombs such as the Royal Game of Ur from ancient Mesopotamia or Senet from ancient Egypt to the popularity of Chess in medieval Islamic courts and empires to the 2007 formation and 2021 extraction of the Afghanistan women's national football team and to the upcoming 2022 Qatar World Cup, sporting and games have been the locus of delight, community, terror, rebellion, and political intrigue throughout the Middle East.","Crisostomo, Jay  ",MIDEAST,291,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Sports and Games in the Middle East,3,HU,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

First Year Seminar in Middle East Studies,"As the cradle of Judaism and Christianity, archaeological remains in Modern Israel receive special attention all over the world. They are seen as the stage on which the events associated with these traditions, such as the life and death of Jesus or the great revolts of the Jews against the Romans, took shape. But they are also part of a fascinating process of identity and conflict between modern Jewish Israelis and Palestinians, which consumes this region in the past century and more. Each of these groups claims ownership over the artifacts of the past, and attempts to incorporate the remains of the past into their current definition of who they are as people. This seminar will study some of the famous archeological excavations and findings from Israel, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the Church of the holy Sepulcher in that same city, and Masada. We will work with two foci – first, to understand the archaeology and its impact on the study of the past, and the second, its role in the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. All material will be provided in English and no prior expertise in archaeology is necessary.","Eliav,Yaron Z",MIDEAST,295,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Archaeology in Israel,3,HU,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.
First Year Seminar in Middle East Studies,"While Job's story has exercised Jewish, Christian, and Muslim interpreters over the centuries, it is more than just the biblical book. It is a tradition that antedates the book and one that has been interpreted, retold, and debated from antiquity to the present. Not only has It inspired visual art through the ages, the Joban story has been variously repurposed in contemporary film and dance. Job is amply represented in the world of music as well, from ancient Jewish and Roman chants to punk rock, and hip-hop. All of these contribute to the conversation in Job about why the innocent suffer, whether there is divine complicity in such undeserved suffering, what these may have to say in regard to the nature of such a God, and the responses of the humanity when confronted with terrible injustice. To varying degrees, the interpretations and retellings of Job shape our perception of what is surely one of the most captivating stories, but unsettling enigmas, ever told.","Schmidt,Brian B",MIDEAST,295,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - The Book of Job,3,HU,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.

Introduction to Egyptian Archaeology,"In this course, we will focus on the material culture and spatial disposition of archaeological sites in northeast Africa, specifically ancient Egyptian and Middle Nile Valley cultures from c. 3200-656 BCE. We will learn about the people who created the objects we study, the logic and nature of both sacred and secular sites they built and inhabited, and the impact of new discoveries on our understanding of the past. We will explore in-depth specific sites, some well-known (such as Tutankhamen’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings, the pyramids at Giza, and Karnak temple), some less well known (such as the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities’ excavations at numerous sites through the Valley, the city of Kerma in northern Sudan, UM’s ongoing excavation at Abydos in Upper Egypt), investigating them as examples of different kinds of interpretive problems in archaeology. We will also consider theoretical approaches to Nile Valley archaeological data, the ways in which material culture remains articulate with other sources of information, issues of stakeholders past and present of cultural heritage including the politics of archaeology and repatriation initiatives; and we'll consider the implications of how ancient Egypt and archaeology appears in film, TV, and other media of public culture. Finally, throughout we will emphasize archaeology of lived experience, not just the privileged environments of political elites, but also the settlements, cemeteries, and cult areas of the communities and individuals who were the majority of the ancient Egyptian population.","Richards,Janet E",MIDEAST,338,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

We will discuss how archaeologists interpret remains of past societies and what role biblical stories have had (and should have) in the process. We will also explore the politics of archaeology—how nationalism and geopolitics affect our reconstruction of the past. In addition, we will discuss how knowledge of archaeology can enrich our understanding of the Bible and other texts from the ancient world, and we will explore the limits of archaeology as a discipline. Chronologically, the course covers a period of approximately a thousand years from the Late Bronze Age (1550 BCE) through the early Achaemenid Period (500 BCE).

We’ll see how the character developed and changed over time, situating each unique manifestation within its historical and cultural contexts. We’ll look at related but distinct figures in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, as well as the ever-evolving portrayal in Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and other traditions, both religious and secular. Important concomitant avenues to pursue include the origin and nature of evil, eschatology, and the fate of the world and the individual soul.

"History, Memory, and Silence in the Middle East","This seminar is an exploration in the anthropological approaches to the study of history and memory. It introduces and problematizes the concept of ‘silence’ in the empty archives, the ruptured oral historical accounts, and the fragments left behind by past events. Taking the demise of the Ottoman Empire as a starting point, the readings probe into the history, historiography, and historicity of minorities, refugees, genocide survivors, as well as undocumented populations and unarchived events to navigate the following questions: How do we trace and represent the past in the aftermath of violence and destruction? How do we conduct research when the evidence is destroyed? What constitutes ‘evidence’ for history? How could we entertain (im)material remnants of the past to rethink our understanding of the ""archive""? The readings are anchored in the ethnography of the Middle East and North Africa, with a comparative reference to the Balkans. We take the Armenian genocide and the politics of its historiography, commemoration, and denial as a case study.

From the Tunisian uprising triggered by the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, to the challenges to the neo-liberal policies of the Erdogan regime in Turkey, anti-corruption protests in Lebanon, the call for democratic change in the region has been perceived as an unprecedented awakening of Middle Eastern society. This course instead will look at the long tradition of social protests and dissident movements in the region. Moreover, we will work against conventional wisdom that thinks the region to be culturally predisposed and ""susceptible to irrational political radicalism, authoritarianism, and terrorism."" Instead, this course will highlight the contentious politics of the poor, women, the working classes, dissident youth and intelligentsia, and various forms of Islamism as responses to socio-economic and political problems and constraints within their historical context. We will utilize Social Movement Theory, a popular field of study in European and North American social sciences, to help us understand some of the underlying dynamics of contentious politics in the Middle East, while at the same time challenging its presumed universal applicability. Through case studies from the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, we will ask: What are the variant reasons for people to contest power? How do people mobilize? Why are some movements institutionalized while others are short-lived and transitory? What kinds of media facilitate mobilization? And what might be their meanings in the national, regional and international contexts? The course materials are made up of academic articles, social biographies, memoirs, music, art, and poetry to provide broad social and cultural insights into contentious politics in the Middle East.","Tanielian,Melanie Schulze",MIDEAST,487,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in Middle East Studies,"This seminar is devoted to unpacking and critically exploring the extraordinary life and work of Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972), one of the most significant Jewish theologians and religious figures of the last century. Thinker and mystic; scholar of rabbinic and Jewish mysticism; Yiddish-language poet, ethicist and controversial social activist, Heschel bridged the worlds of East European Hasidism, Weimar culture, and 1960’s political engagement. In this seminar, we will interweave biography and cultural history, with a close reading of his central theological, devotional and topical works (ranging from God in Search of Man; The Sabbath; Kotzk; and Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity). In the closing weeks of the course, we will explore Heschel’s influence on contemporary theology, and issues of spirituality, education and ecology, and social justice). While the required reading will be in English, the instructor will make available Heschel’s works in the original German, Yiddish, and Hebrew, as well.","Ginsburg,Elliot K",MIDEAST,490,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - The Life and Thought of Abraham Joshua Heschel: Writer, Mystic and Social Justice Advocate",3,,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Contemporary Issues in Museums,"


This course is intended to complement MUSEUMS 301’s historical orientation with an examination of major areas of concern in the contemporary museum world. Certain themes are expected to receive treatment on an annual basis (e.g., the depiction of ethnic, racial, religious, and gender issues in museum displays, ethics, the ownership of cultural heritage materials, changes in museum funding and its impact on museums, etc.), while other themes will receive attention as merited by news of the day. Of key pedagogical importance is the seminar format for the class which will allow for dynamic group discussion and in-depth examination of the issues at hand. A case study approach will predominate but will be supplemented by appropriate additional readings to create the necessary theoretical context for discussion. 
Because of the contemporary focus of the course, students will be encouraged to further supplement their understanding of issues through participation in listservs, web searching, following the popular media, and research on positions taken by various professional organizations. Similarly, students will learn about contemporary issues facing museums through direct engagement with host partner museums who will identify an issue of institutional concern for the class to research during the term. Student teams will engage with museum staff to learn about the issue, understand its impact on the museum, study best practices at other institutions, conduct a literature search, research the greater context for the problem, and develop a set of recommendations. Such an approach allows students to engage with historical precedent, relevant theory and scholarship, and the reality of practice. The small seminar setting (fewer than 25 students) will allow students to engage closely with faculty, visiting lecturers, and other students, resulting in a deeper understanding of the issues facing contemporary museums.","Hennebury, Deirdre Laura Christianson",MUSEUMS,401,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Special Topics in Museum Studies,"The relation of the museum to society is complex and in a state of change. Museums – traditionally characterized as static, defiantly resistant to change - are responding by assuming new roles, fashioning new societal relationships, and reconfiguring themselves around a variety of cultural and heritage resources. A key element of this redefinition has been the use of architecture. ""Starchitects,"" including such figures as Frank Lloyd Wright, Frank Gehry, Renzo Piano, and David Adjaye, have created museum spaces that change the way objects are viewed and cultural narratives are presented. The goal of this course is to introduce the area of museum architecture, focusing on design decisions at the scale of the exhibit, building, and urban setting. A range of issues debated in contemporary museology will be treated, including museum space; object, authenticity, and experience; the relationship of museums to their communities; the museum as an educator; and architectural aesthetics.","Barenblit, Ferran  ",MUSEUMS,498,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,MUSEUMS 301 or MSP 601.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Intro World Music,"Drawing on the discipline of ethnomusicology –the study of music in and as culture, this course examines the ways in which meanings, behavior, and identities are constructed. By investigating the soundscapes of selected world cultures in the US [including Native America], Latin America, South India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Papua New Guinea, African diaspora in the US, Nigeria, Uganda, and South Africa, this course enhances critical reflection upon the multiple views of world soundscapes and calls to mind the intertwining nature of sonic-spatial practices, discourses about such practices, as well as the social/political conditions that give rise to such sonic-spatial practices in the first place. We will draw particular attention to the ways that religious, political, and economic factors shape identities among various performers and consumers of soundscapes. Positioning varying practices of soundscapes within the context of postcolonial, technological, as well as transnational development, we will critically analyze the ever-changing balance between traditional and modern ideas of soundscapes – in systems of learning, performance techniques, as well as ways of writing, circulating, and recording music.","Lwanga,Charles",MUSICOL,122,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,NON-MUS ONLY.,,May not be repeated for credit.

History of US Musics,"This course examines musical creativity with an emphasis on nearby places (the United States) and recent times (the late-20th and 21st centuries), while highlighting the analytical and research skills needed to ask and answer questions relevant to the history and social import of music as an art form. The course explores questions of how music has served as an expressive tool for individual creativity, identity formation, placemaking, and political commentary. Music is interrogated not as an isolated object, but as a social activity in a community context and as a catalyst for social change. Musicology 140 strives to inspire active and creative engagement with the ideas and events of the musical past to fuel the imagination of artists hoping to contribute to a fuller present and richer future. Identity and race are major themes, as the many peoples and cultures within the United States are what makes its music distinctive and inspiring. The course builds on the ideas introduced in Musicology 139 and works to prepare students for the one-year Western music survey of Musicology 239 and 240.","Clague -- he him, Mark  ",MUSICOL,140,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,2,HU,,,S M STU ONLY.,,May not be repeated for credit.

History of Music,"This lecture / discussion course for non-music majors examines how music was understood, conceived, performed, and heard in the Europe from the late Roman Empire through the 14 th century. Topics covered early in the term include the place of musical harmony in cosmology; ancient Western beliefs about human nature and music; the adaptation of ancient ideas about music in the Middle Ages. As manuscript sources with notation become increasingly plentiful in the 11 th century, students will engage with the actual music and its written sources, considering how it was composed and performed, and what it communicated. The focus will then shift among five sites of musical performance: the monastery (plainchant), the castle (Troubadour and Trouvère songs), the cathedral (devotional part-music), the urban square (dance songs and motets), and the palace (part-music on themes of Courtly Love, fin’ amors).  All readings are in English, including translations of source readings.","Borders,James M",MUSICOL,345,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Music in Medieval Culture,3,HU,,,NON-MUS ONLY.,,May not be repeated for credit.
History of Music,"As a narrative genre, science fiction often encourages us to ponder the spiritual, moral, and social implications of scientific and technological innovations, both as they exist in the imagined worlds constructed within these narratives and in the actual world these narratives reflect and confront. In science fiction film and television, music and sound design plays a pivotal role in constructing and enhancing the fantastical settings in which these narratives play out, while offering us insights into character traits and emotions, and helping to weave together the disparate scenes and plot developments involved in telling a story that traverses space and time. 

In this course we explore the intersections between music and scientific fiction film and television from a variety of perspectives. We trace the historical evolution of the genre through the analysis of key contributions, from Forbidden Planet (1956) and Star Trek (1966–69), to Battlestar Galactica (2004–2009) and Interstellar (2015). We consider the aesthetic, technical, and creative choices made by influential creative figures, while contemplating the impact of technological innovations in sound and cinema. We also situate important instances of music in science fiction within the wider social, cultural, and political contexts in which it is created.","Bodiford, James Ryan",MUSICOL,346,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Science Fiction Film Music,3,HU,,,NON-MUS ONLY.,,May not be repeated for credit.

What skills and knowledge can we harness to better understand music of the past and present that we encounter in the current moment? Throughout the semester we will research and think critically about music as utilitarian, affective, and more. We will examine how it participates in social settings, political movements, negotiations of identity, the marketplace, etc. In doing so, we will expand preconceived notions about musicology to include myriad genres of music as well as applied and public-facing work. Likewise, we will re-imagine our world as it is experienced with and through music.","Castro,Christi-Anne",MUSICOL,407,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Everyday Musicology,3,,,,UG ONLY.,Graduate students elect MUSICOL 507.,May be repeated for credit.

"Moral Puzzles, Inner Conflicts","

In this course, we will explore several moral issues, focusing, in particular, on the tensions in our own views about these issues.   The two main aims of the course are 
 to gain some insight into the extent and scope of our moral obligations and .
 to develop the skills that enable us to clarify and evaluate our own moral beliefs.  Each issue we consider will force us to confront how difficult it is for us to reach a fully coherent position -- and how much we can learn from struggling to attain this goal.  
The issues will include at least some of the following:  what are our obligations to people in need?  what are our obligations to nonhuman animals?  under what circumstances are we permitted to deliberately harm someone?  under what circumstances are we responsible for acting wrongly?Course Requirements:Class participation, discussion posts (on Canvas), quizzes, final exam, papersIntended Audience:Any students interested in the topics covered in the course, and in learning how to think through these problems with the rigor characteristic of philosophyClass Format:2 50-minute lectures, 2 discussion sections lead by a GSI","Buss, Sarah  ",PHIL,275,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Honors Introduction to Philosophy,"Philosophers have raised powerful questions about some of our most deeply-held beliefs: for example, that there is an external world, that we have reason to think that the sun will rise tomorrow, that we can tell the difference between right and wrong, and that we don’t lose our identities even as our bodies and beliefs change. This course will introduce you to philosophy through a discussion of these and other central questions having to do with the self, the world, the possibility of knowledge, and our obligations to others. Along the way, you’ll also learn important philosophical skills such as understanding and responding to others’ arguments and constructing persuasive arguments of your own.","Sethi,Janum",PHIL,297,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,Honors,,Honors students or permission of instructor.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in Philosophy,"In this course, we will work together to gain a historically grounded, philosophical understanding of race, racial categories, and racial injustice.  The course is divided into three units: (1) Metaphysics (2) Social and Political (3) Epistemology.

Introduction to Formal Philosophical Methods,"Many philosophical debates have been enhanced by the use of mathematical tools. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to those tools, and enhance their skills in using them. Any student who is interested in the use of mathematical tools in reasoning, either because they want to use those tools themselves, or because they want to critically examine others' usage of the tools, will benefit from the course.

We will start with propositional and predicate logic, which is presupposed in everything else we do, and is relevant to the analysis of arguments.

Then we will look at modal logic, the logic of 'must'. This is relevant to the theory of necessity in metaphysics, to the theory of knowledge in epistemology, and to the theory of obligation in ethics.

We will look at 'non-classical' logics, and why some logician have thought that we need to modify logic itself to solve philosophical puzzles.

The final part of the course will look at probability, decision making and game playing. We will go over the orthodox theory of how rational agents think and act under uncertainty. And we will look at applications of this theory to explaining puzzles from the history of science and from economics. Then we will look at the theory of games, the theory of how agents act when their outcomes depend on what they do, and on what other rational agents do. We will explain the fundamental notion of game theory, Nash equilibrium, and show how game theory can be used to explain puzzling behavior.","Weatherson,Brian James",PHIL,305,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, MSA, QR/1",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Minds and Machines,"
This course will discuss minds, machines, the relationships between them, and the relationships they encourage and discourage. Throughout we will compare and contrast human minds and brains with machine ‘minds’ and ‘brains,’ considering questions like: Could a machine have a mind? Could a machine be conscious, or think in the ways that people do? What can human brains teach us about how a thinking machine might work, and vice versa? What might information processing, information integration, and information availability have to do with consciousness? Could the internet be conscious? How could we tell? How do machines and our interactions with them influence how humans think, learn, reason, and know? What are the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, big data, and gargantuan networks, especially when the underlying mechanics of machine and network reasoning are not transparent to us? How should machines be treated—including machines that exhibit some but not all features of human minds? Why? How should machines treat us?","Swanson, Eric  ",PHIL,340,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Language and Mind,"Philosophy 345 aims to provide students with a broad overview of some of the main problems in the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind. In philosophy of language we will focus on the theory of reference (naming) and its relation to questions about belief and modality. In philosophy of mind we discuss physicalism, dualism, behaviorism, the identity theory, functionalist accounts of the mind, the question of machine intelligence, and the problem of explaining conscious experience. A second, equally important, goal of the course is to help students develop their skills at careful reading, critical reasoning, and argumentative writing.","Joyce,James M",PHIL,345,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Ethics,"One of the most important questions one can ask is the central question of ethics: How should I live my life? Thinking about this question immediately leads to a whole host of other questions: Are there objective facts about how I should live? Or is ethics just a matter of opinion? And if there are objective truths in ethics, then what are they? What is a good life for a human being? How are we obligated to treat others? And what should we do when our good conflicts with the good of others? For instance, are we obligated to help those who are in poverty? And do we have any moral obligations to non-humans, such as animals?","Lowe, Dan  ",PHIL,361,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,F.,May not be repeated for credit.
19th Century Social and Political Philosophy,"Historians speak of the ""long 19th century,"" from 1789 (the French Revolution) to 1914 (World War I). Four revolutions during this period pose the central themes of European social and political thought in this ""longer 19th century."" The Industrial Revolution radically transformed the conditions of labor and gave rise to the first realistic proposals to abolish poverty. The French Revolution established a republic founded on liberal ideals of individual freedom--ideals that women, as well as men, pursued. The Haitian Revolution was the first successful slave revolt in history, launching waves of abolitionism across the Americas. The Revolutions of 1848 sparked nationalist aspirations among the peoples of Europe that posed profound challenges to liberalism and imperialism. This course will study classic works of social and political philosophy by Constant, Burke, J. S. Mill, Hegel, Douglass, Herder, Marx, Dubois, Wollstonecraft, and others, stressing the connections between these works and the social and political problems to which they were responding. The course will be organized around the following themes: labor and class conflict, distributive justice, liberalism, nationalism, feminism, abolitionism, racism, and imperialism. We will also examine connections between 19th-century ideas and 21st-century politics.","Anderson,Elizabeth S",PHIL,367,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Nietzsche's Philosophical Thought,"Nietzsche & Rand & Us
Friedrich Nietzsche and Ayn Rand are both famous philosophers (and literary dynamos) who crucially defend:
	atheism (no gods, no otherworldly afterlife), and so
	biologically-based ethics (with earthly life the ultimate value), and so 
	capitalism (over socialism)

Nietzsche’s route to (1) and (2) is a kind of wishful thinking, which Rand would denounce. Rand’s route to (1) and (2) is an attempted proof with certainty, which Nietzsche would denounce. We’ll referee that contest, and in case both sides lose, we’ll consider whether some better third approach to reasoning should also lead to (1) and (2).

Environmental Ethics-Living Well with Nature,"The fact that humanity's relationship to nature has gone awry is rarely disputed, but the proposed cures are manifold. How should humans value the non-human world? Do humans have ethical duties to entities other than fellow humans? 

This course investigates a variety of proposed answers that claim to better situate humans with respect to nature. Such systems include variations on anthropocentrism, including a number of e-centric cousins (ecocentrism, biocentrism, zoocentrism, etc.) as well as movements such as deep ecology and ecofeminism. Current questions and controversies will be used to highlight the alternative visions that these various philosophies offer. Also considered will be the components of personal and communal ethics that lead to changes in praxis.

Post-Aristotelian Philosophy,"This term we will focus on Ancient Scepticism, which not only puts in question whether we can have any kind of knowledge but indeed whether we can rationally accept any belief at all. Uncompromising in the extreme, it has exercised a large influence over the subsequent history of Western philosophy, not only in the Renaissance and Early Modern periods, but down to the present day. We will examine their approach to philosophy through a close reading of Sextus Empiricus' Outlines of Pyrrhonism and selections from his larger work, Adversus mathematicos (Against the Learned), but we will also look at ancient and modern reactions to this form of scepticism, including whether it is a coherent philosophy and whether it is actually possible to live a human life in accordance with it.","Caston,Victor",PHIL,393,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Philosophy of Language,"Over the last 150 years or so, philosophers of language have made major advances in our understanding of human language understanding. Many of these advances raise fascinating questions about the prospects for artificial intelligence systems that deal with language. How much of language understanding is purely conventional? How much is innate? How much is social? How much is mediated by our causal connections to the world? How much is rule-governed? In what sense? How much is affected by our values, interests, and goals, and our knowledge of them? How much does language understanding depend on other forms of understanding? What kinds of answers should we expect to questions like “What does that sentence mean?” How do the answers to these questions matter for AI? In what ways is some language harmful? How can we tell? How could an AI tell? This course investigates these questions and more, providing a foundation in analytic philosophy of language and the basics of contemporary artificial intelligence (at a high level of abstraction — no coding expected!) All this will allow us to discuss questions about automated content selection, promotion, and moderation with an improved sense of what makes such work so important and so challenging.","Swanson, Eric  ",PHIL,409,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,"PHIL 296, 303, or 414.",,May not be repeated for credit.

Philosophy of Film,"From the moment film came into being in the 1890s a furious and excited attempt on the part of filmmakers took place to discover the possibilities of this new medium, a vast innovation in “film language”. At the same time an equally intense set of conversations and writings by critics, philosophers, intellectuals, and many others began to emerge which sought to articulate the powers, capacities, the possibilities of the new medium. A wide variety of writings have tried to fathom film’s immediate popularity and its social forces (actual and potential). They have interrogated the way film frames women, solicits voyeurism and idealization, fancifies and naturalizes the world, creates a new aesthetic category of person called the star. Since there is no form of art and communication more central to contemporary life than film (more crucial to the fabric of our beliefs, ideologies, enjoyment, politics, advertisements) these features of the medium have been discussed with considerable urgency throughout film history.

Groups and Choices,"
 

This course studies the distinctive issues about choices and decisions that arise when we're making decisions in groups.  

We will look at work by philosophers, economists and political scientists on the best ways to make choices in social situations, and to think about how and why people make the choices they do. The first part of the course will cover game theory, the second part will cover voting theory, and the last part will concern group agency.

The course is structured to move from more individualistic to more social perspectives. We start with self-interested agents, who only care about other agents insofar as choices those other agents make influence the outcome they get. Over the course we make the focus more and more social, until we end with discussion of whether groups can know things, and choose things, that no member of the group knows, or chooses. 

At every stage, we mix discussion of mathematical modeling of the choice situation with philosophical work on the appropriateness of those models. So the course will have something to offer students who need to learn about the mathematical modeling, and students who would like to see more critical reflection on the mathematical tools they have acquired.","Weatherson,Brian James",PHIL,444,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Philosophy of Cognition,"Maybe by now you’ve grown accustomed to or disappointed by philosophers’ approaching issues via their “intuitions” or via various “isms” assumed for argument’s sake. Here we’ll try to work out instead how things go if we start assessing cognition from scratch. None of the familiar intuitions or competing isms allowed as assumptions. I hope that quest strikes you as a fun and refreshing challenge, poised to help find common ground even among extremely distant disputants.","Lormand, Eric  ",PHIL,450,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,Two courses in Philosophy.,,May not be repeated for credit.

In PHIL 498 or 499, which is taken in the semester following PHIL 401, students work with a thesis supervisor to develop their ideas into a thesis of appropriate length (usually 40-50 pages, double-spaced). At the end of this process, they defend their thesis at an oral exam, conducted by a committee of two professors, one of whom supervised the thesis. The award of the honors degree requires successful defense of the thesis and the level of honors (honors, high honors, highest honors) is determined on the basis of thesis and defense. Before a student enrolls in PHIL 498 or 499, Honors candidates must submit a thesis proposal to the department for its approval.

Fundamental Physics for the Life Sciences I,"Have you ever wondered how physics is important and useful in the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine? BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 150 is a new introductory physics course that will reveal the synergy between these fields and explore fundamental physics principles that are ubiquitous in the life sciences. Biology, chemistry, and medicine will provide our guiding motivation and context for exploring first-semester physics topics including energy, mechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics. These topics will be covered in the depth and manner in which they appear on the MCAT and in life science courses. In line with this, students will also learn to use quantitative reasoning, develop mathematical models, and engage in scientific dialogue with a diverse group of future scientists and healthcare professionals. This course examines physical concepts through biological examples and consists of both interactive lectures and studio meetings to facilitate student learning and enhance student performance. Lectures will encourage student participation through a variety of in-class activities in which students work directly with, discuss, and respond to lecture material and demonstrations. During studio meetings, students will gain hands-on experience solving problems in small groups, facilitated by an instructor and peer learning assistants.","Lubensky,David K",PHYSICS,150,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS, QR/1",,,"MATH 115, 120, 185, or 295; knowledge of differential and integral calculus minimally at the level of MATH 115, or its high school equivalent, will be needed.

Fundamental Physics for the Life Sciences II,"Have you ever wondered how physics is important and useful in the fields of biology chemistry, and medicine? BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 250 is a new introductory physics course that will reveal the synergy between these fields and explore fundamental physics principles that are ubiquitous in the life sciences. Biology, chemistry, and medicine will provide our guiding motivation and context for exploring first-semester physics topics including energy, mechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics. These topics will be covered in the depth and manner in which they appear on the MCAT and in life science courses. In line with this, students will also learn to use quantitative reasoning, develop mathematical models, and engage in scientific dialogue with a diverse group of future scientists and healthcare professionals. This course examines physical concepts through biological examples and consists of both interactive lectures and studio meetings to facilitate student learning and enhance student performance. Lectures will encourage student participation through a variety of in-class activities in which students work directly with, discuss, and respond to lecture material and demonstrations. During studio meetings, students will gain hands-on experience solving physics problems in small groups, facilitated by an instructor and peer learning assistants.","Meiners,Jens-Christian D",PHYSICS,250,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS, QR/1",,,"PHYSICS 135 or BIOPHYS/PHYSICS 150.

PHYSIOL 201 is intended to meet the needs and expectations of many types of students: those preparing for careers as doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and biology teachers; those who are interested in a systematic investigation of the biological sciences; and those who desire a general knowledge of physiology as part of a liberal arts education. Students must have at least sophomore standing or permission of instructor.

Chemistry Background for Introductory Physiology Courses. Although college chemistry is not a course prerequisite, approximately 80% of the students electing PHYSIOL 201 have had some college or high school chemistry. A background in chemistry is helpful for a basic understanding of physiology since physiology represents an attempt to explain how the body functions in terms of physical and chemical processes. Students who have had no chemistry or whose high school chemistry background is weak should not be discouraged from electing PHYSIOL 201. However, such students are encouraged to obtain the textbook prior to the start of the course and study the review chapter covering basic chemistry. While it is not necessary to master all the material contained in the review chapter, a general review of basic chemistry prior to the beginning of the term usually proves helpful.","Rust,Elizabeth McLaurine",PHYSIOL,201,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"NS, BS",,,Students must have at least sophomore standing.

Poland in the Modern World,"If you want drama and tragedy, then you will certainly get plenty of that in History 331. This course presents the story of Poland, a country that was restored to the map in 1918 after more than a century of foreign occupation, only to fall to a joint attack by Hitler and Stalin in 1939, endure five years at the very deepest circle of the Nazi hell, and then be “liberated” by a Soviet puppet government that ruled with an iron fist for four more decades. Through all this tribulation there were many attempts at liberation and reform, so this course will offer plenty of heroes. But if all you want is a story of good and evil, emancipation and oppression, then you will probably find History 331 disappointing. The real goal of the class will be to get beyond the familiar stories and come to an understanding of what it was like to actually live in Poland during the 20th century. We will focus on the ambiguities and uncertainties, the happiness that persisted in the face of difficult circumstances and the tragedies that invariably accompanied every victory. In a land that experienced rule by Nazism, Communism, and Capitalism, we will have a chance to see what all three systems really meant, not just as ideologies but as lived experiences. The readings for this class will consist mostly of primary sources that will present you with the actual voices of the people who will be studying. This will include memoirs, political documents, audio and video recordings, and more. There will also be a textbook that offers a broad overview of modern Polish history.","Porter-Szucs, Brian  ",POLISH,331,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"HU, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Polish Drama in Context,"Unlike what we find in most of the English-speaking world, where “attending” a theater performance is generally treated as a special occasion and an entertainment, theater in Poland is ubiquitous, extremely diverse, and closely bound to current public discourses. All major cities, and many smaller ones, have theaters for every taste, theater festivals can be found throughout the country, and important theatrical productions have been broadcast on live television since 1953. This course examines the theater’s role in reflecting and shaping Poland’s turbulent, fascinating history. Unlike a conventional survey, however, our genre-based exploration will begin in the present and work backwards, reverse-engineering the prominent role that theater and dramatic texts continue to play in Polish society. 

This course adopts an interdisciplinary, critical-humanities approach to the intersection of literature, history, and performance. Secondary readings are drawn from history, anthropology, and performance theory, and students will be challenged to consider how drama both reflects contemporaneous public discourse and helps shape it.Course Requirements:Short paper (1000 words), midterm paper (1500 words), final paper (2500 words), midterm exam, final exam.Intended Audience:This course is for undergraduates interested in literature, culture, and performance. It will appeal especially to students of literature, international studies, cultural anthropology, and theater, and more generally to those interested in an interdisciplinary humanities experience.Class Format:The course meets for two ninety-minute lectures per week across the full semester.

Introduction to Comparative Politics,"This course is an introduction to the social scientific study of comparative politics. The course is motivated by questions that are relevant to the understanding of politics today. These questions include: why are some countries democratic and others authoritarian? What are the explanations for rapid growth and development in some parts of the world but not others? How do racial, ethnic, and class divisions emerge and persist in different societies? How do different types of political institutions affect outcomes such as inequality, political participation, and regime stability? How have different political systems responded to the strains of globalization and increased economic integration? This course examines these questions through a broad comparative lens that covers many countries and regions in the world, rather than focusing on specific country cases.","Gallagher,Mary E",POLSCI,140,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,Primarily for first- and second-year students.,"F, W.",May not be repeated for credit.

We’ll explore the context and significance of its ratification; the claims about political judgment that it made and performed; the nature of the public ideology it expressed and launched; and its reception through American political history.","Zeisberg,Mariah A",POLSCI,190,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003, - Declaration of Independence,3,SS,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.
American Political Thought: Late,"POLSCI 307 will take up one question that political theorists ask: what is the best life? As the U.S. successfully emerged from WWII and eased into “the nifty ‘50’s”, consensus opinion held that Americans were enjoying a version of the best life. As incomes rose, some even posited an age of political consensus and “the end of ideology.” However, challenges loomed, and ideological contestation and dissent didn’t die after all. Contestation in the post-war era touched on some key categories in political theory: justice, equality, freedom, citizenship, and public voice. Some of the specific issues this class will consider: consumer culture, rural and urban poverty, environmentalism, public health, civil rights, race hierarchy, women’s rights, youth culture, the new left, gay rights (as it was then called), neo-conservatism, immigration, the red scare, atomic build-up, the cold war, state secrecy, and the military draft.","Manuel,Anne M",POLSCI,307,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,POLSCI 101 or 111.,,May be elected twice for credit.

The kind of understanding you won't get by reading the newspaper.  By the end, students will  understand the strengths and uses of various modeling approaches used in the social sciences and be able to use them. This is not a mathematics course, but it does require a willingness to think abstractly, to carefully contemplate lots of charts and figures, and to do a little algebra.

The failure of wealthy industrial nations to rein in the acceleration of either wealth inequalities or climate change may provide evidence not just that our biggest problems are hard for democracies to solve but that democratic processes—mass voting, partisan representation, organized interests—may even intensify these problems and put the solutions farther and farther out of reach.","Disch,Lisa Jane",POLSCI,406,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,POLSCI 101 or 302.,,May not be repeated for credit.

Advanced Topics in Contemporary Political Science,"Courts and judges are inherently political: their decisions determine who gets what at whose expense. This is a course about courts as a political institution, taught using a philosophy of institutional analysis. We will introduce theories about courts, including theories about how judges bargain, how hierarchy shapes judicial decision-making, and how agencies behave in the shadow of judicial review. (Most of these will be formal theories, using the tools of game theory and decision theory.) We will also read empirical analyses of courts. Some examples of empirical questions we will ask are: are judges biased? Are courts independent? How do judges influence their colleagues' behavior? (Most of these will be quantitative empirical analyses, using the tools of statistics, regression, and causal inference.) In this course, you will learn about courts and judges. In the course of doing so, you will also hone your skills for reading papers that use game theory and papers that use statistical analysis.","Beim,Deborah",POLSCI,489,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - Judicial Politics,3,,,,Seniors only.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Undergraduate Seminar in Political Theory,"War is not a gender-neutral space. Wartime actors are marked by their gender and gender itself is re-imagined in the context of war. This course explores how narratives of gender difference, state power, and militarism overlap, disquiet, and mutually reinforce each other. Particular attention will be paid to several theoretical explorations: women as the bearers of culture, feminist critiques of war, refugee crises in which the camp is an alternative to the home, how masculinity is redefined during wartime, narratives that deploy the assumption of violent conflict as the “natural"" ordefault mode of human interaction as compared to narratives that turn on the assumption of peace as the ""natural"" or default mode, and how wartime conditions can advance or limit claims about gender equality and gender justice. We will combine a more theoretical analysis with some current debates: women in combat in the U.S. military, rape in the U.S. military, rape as a crime of war, and the history of women in the peace movement.","Manuel,Anne M",POLSCI,495,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Women and War: Contemporary and Historical Perspectives,3,,,With permission of instructor.,,,May be elected twice for credit.

In this class, we will trace the circulations of people, ideas, and languages between these two spaces, which, despite often being studied as separate spheres, actually share similar trajectories of national formation. Moving from the Italian Risorgimento to our present day, we will follow various figures and texts as they illustrate Italy and Latin America’s common quest for belonging in the so-called modern world. Through a careful selection of materials, we will also recreate the translanguaging between Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese that resulted from the circulation of people and ideas. While the main language of the class will be Italian, both advanced Spanish and Portuguese speakers are welcome to join, as there will be plenty of opportunities to work collaboratively and build our integrated system of communication.

"Introduction to Biopsychology, for Non-BCN or Non-Neuroscience majors","The primary goal of Biopsychology (or “Behavioral Neuroscience”) is to establish relationships between brain systems/neuronal mechanisms and behavioral or cognitive functions. Biopsychology integrates methods and research approaches of a wide variety of scientific disciplines, ranging from the cellular and molecular neurosciences to the psychology of perception and cognition. This introductory course for non-majors covers a wide range of topics in Biopsychology from the structure and function of a neuron and neural transmission, to integrating sensory information, to the output of behavior. To this end, students will gain a basic understanding of brain development, sensory and motor systems, learning and memory and the biopsychology of emotion and motivation. Finally, the students will investigate neuroscience-related diseases and disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s Disease.","Cummings,Jennifer A",PSYCH,220,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"BS, NS",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Entrepreneurial Creativity,"This class was created to serve as the LSA core course for the Entrepreneurship minor and considers creativity as a construct as well as a process within the larger concept of entrepreneurship while grounding course content in a semester-long group project. We will consider the elements of creative thinking, personal characteristics related to creativity, and team dynamics/leadership skills needed to participate in and lead creative groups.  Some questions we will consider include:  Is creative thinking somehow different from “normal” thinking? What sort of characteristics foster creativity for individuals and groups?  What is the relation between idea generation and collaborative teamwork? How do entrepreneurs in business, social goods, and technology development and employ vital skills in persuasion, cooperation, communication as they bring ideas to life in the form of enterprises? This course will explore all these questions in order to ground students in both the theory and practice of creativity as it takes shape in entrepreneurial endeavors.","Fretz,Eric B",PSYCH,223,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,"Does not count toward the requirements for the Psychology or Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neuroscience majors.",May not be repeated for credit.

Language and Human Mind,"This course introduces students to the ""cognitive revolution"" and its impact on the contemporary study of language. We review the shift away from seeing speech behavior or ""languages"" as the object of inquiry to the experimental and theoretical study of the cognitive mechanisms underlying our unique human capacity for language, the exercise of which permeates virtually every aspect of human life, including what you are now doing! In every household, all of the children, barring pathology - but none of the dogs, cats or other organisms (nor the inanimate objects!) - acquire the language spoken or signed by the adults. There is some biological property of humans that makes this feat possible. What do we know when we know a language, and what does it mean to say that humans have an innate capacity for language?","Brennan,Jonathan R",PSYCH,242,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,Does not count toward the requirements for the Psychology major.,May not be repeated for credit.

Minds and Brains in America,"What is the mind? And how does it relate to the brain? These are old, even ancient questions, but it is only in the last two centuries that specific scientific fields have arisen to answer them. This course explores the history of those fields (psychology, psychiatry, and cognitive science) and their impact on American politics, popular culture, and private life. The science and medicine of mind and brain have deeply shaped who we are, what we do, and how we treat others (including people, animals, and machines). This course examines key moments in this history: from the rise of the asylum and phrenology around 1800, through the growth of eugenics and psychoanalysis a century later, to the advent of MRI and artificial intelligence in recent years. By tracing the tools used to study, police, and alter the minds and brains of ordinary Americans, we will work toward a new history of scientific authority in the United States.","Cowles,Henry",PSYCH,265,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Special Problems in Psychology as a Social Science,"This upper-level seminar provides an introduction to the relatively new field of positive psychology—the scientific study of positive experience, positive traits, positive relationships, and the institutions and practices that facilitate their development--and the broader science of happiness. 


While psychology has traditionally concentrated on ""fixing what is wrong"" (e.g., ameliorating depression, anxiety, and other disorders), positive psychology focuses on ""cultivating what is right"" (e.g., promoting happiness and flourishing) and what makes life worth living. Guided by this growing body of cross-disciplinary research and interest in positive psychology since 1998, we will investigate what human characteristics and experiences lead to personal happiness and fulfillment and what conditions elicit them.  


Special attention to the determinants of flourishing relationships is warranted because among the most important and consistent findings in positive psychology research is that our interpersonal relationships have the greatest impact on physical and psychological well-being. 


We will thus examine, for example, the effects of positive interpersonal traits like gratitude and forgiveness, as well as positive relationships. Areas of controversy within the field of positive psychology (e.g., What is happiness, what determines it, can we deliberately increase it, and is there an optimal level of happiness?) will also be discussed.


This course will not only review the perspectives, research methods, and empirical findings of the growing field of positive psychology but it will also encourage you to explore the applications of positive psychology, particularly in domains that are relevant to you as young adults. The majority of students who have previously taken my positive psychology course reported experiencing positive life-changes as a result, in addition to a deeper understanding of the theories, methods, and findings in this fast-growing discipline.

"Energy and Climate Change: Technology, Markets, and Policy","
Energy is an incredibly complex topic by virtue of the inter-linkages of science, technology, public policy, economics, and human behaviors. This course will examine all aspects of energy: supply and demand, technical and social, with a concerted look at the natural place of social science (behavior, pricing, externalities, social norms) in the energy sphere. 

Every aspect of present-day society depends on the continuing availability of clean, affordable, flexible, secure, and safe energy resources. Yet nearly 90% of our current energy needs are met by fossil fuels. Our reliance on fossil fuels has led to declining supplies, rising prices, global climate change, and security concerns. The current global energy economy is not sustainable. The technological challenges are formidable; but they cannot be considered solutions without considering the human and social behavioral side of energy demand. 

The quest for solutions to ""The Energy Problem"" is dominated by technology ""fixes"". The visions of practical technological fixes, whether electricity energy generation, oil exploration and extraction, pollution mitigation, automobile fuel efficiency and alternatives to combustion engines, etc., necessarily build on what we know today and presume that we can achieve in a couple of decades or so, through sufficient R&D, an energy supply-demand balance that fulfills a wide range of incompatible requirements —  cheap, environmentally benign, politically secure, unconstrained supply, convenient, and safe. While we expect technology to come to our energy-rescue and support our established patterns of economic growth and energy-intensive lifestyles, we tend to expect very little from the human and social behavioral side of energy use and demand. In some ways the Energy Problem is yet another version of C.P. Snow's Two Cultures — parallel technology and social cultures with little mutual understanding and rare cross-over exchange. 

 The Complex Systems view would hold that society and Energy technologies have coevolved through the actions of individual agents (inventors, scientists, entrepreneurs, financiers, writers, politicians, kings and queens, dictators, and statesman), learning, adapting, selecting, exchanging information, and interacting through transactions of many kinds. At every stage, the social, economic, and technological systems were tightly coupled. It is not possible to understand Energy Problems without framing them in a systems context.Course Requirements:Two midterm exams, a Final Exam, graded homework assignments, and a term project.Intended Audience:Freshmen and Sophomores interested in energy and complex systems. Class Format:3 hours of lecture per week. ","Raimi,Daniel",PUBPOL,250,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"BS, QR/1",Sustain,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

First Year Seminar,"Ever wonder why a signed and dated urinal, placed upside down in a museum, gets to be called art? Or why that song sounds more like noise than music? What’s the point of a poem that resists logical meaning at every turn? Or a designer dress made out of meat? Art, in its various forms, often seeks to confront us, and this course considers what the purpose of such strange encounters might be as well as how the strange, itself, can serve as resistance and protest. We will consider a range of artistic examples from Dada to Oulipo, rap to queer camp, produced by artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Gertrude Stein, N.W.A., Harryette Mullen, Lady Gaga, and Claudia Rankine, drawing upon intellectual approaches from literary studies, philosophy, art history, gender and queer studies, and critical race theory. We will explore how weird art defamiliarizes—makes the familiar strange—and can open up new possibilities in the process. But such disruption can be uncomfortable, unexpected, and unwanted, much like protest and activism. As part of our ongoing exploration, we will consider the interplay between discomfort and effectiveness, particularly in the context of social change.","Brandel,Darcy L",RCCORE,100,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Art and Everyday Life,4,FYWR,,With permission of department.,"SWC Writing Assessment.

First Year Seminar,"When Malcolm X was incarcerated in 1946 at age 20, he was functionally illiterate. By painstakingly copying page after page of the dictionary, however, he taught himself to read, ultimately proclaiming, “Months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up to then, I never had been so truly free in my life.” In this first-year writing seminar, we will explore how writers discuss and help us to understand various experiences of confinement and liberation/freedom. Together we will ask: What are ways that people experience physical, emotional, linguistic, and/or social confinement? How is confinement imposed and by whom? What does resistance look like, and what do confinement and resistance have to tell us about liberation and freedom? We will engage with diverse authors, texts, and genres, and students will develop and hone their writing skills through varied short writing assignments; 3-4 major essays; and regular peer reviews and essay revisions.","Pickus, Becca  ",RCCORE,100,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - The Personal Essay,4,FYWR,,With permission of department.,"SWC Writing Assessment.

Fathers and Sons,"Throughout the ages, from Odysseus and Telemachus (The Odyssey) to Willie Loman and Biff (Death of a Salesman), stories about complex and passionate relationships between fathers and sons have been the stuff of great literature.  In the case of Antigone's narcissistic Creon who demands that  his son obey him totally, tragedy is the result.  Because sons want their fathers to be models of behavior and beliefs they can respect and emulate, when the father satisfies these expectations--and we shall encounter a number who do--the father often becomes a hero.  In instances in which a father fails to live up to these expectations or offers the wrong goals, as in the case of Willie Loman, the result is often a series of torturous confrontations.  We  will examine novels, short stories, plays, poems and films that chronicle both harmonious and troubled  relationships:  novels such as Ingmar Bergman's Sunday's Children, Saul Bellow's Seize the Day, Richard Russo's The Risk Pool, Art Spiegelman's (""comic"" book) Maus:  A Survivor's Tale; short stories such as Ernest Hemingway's ""Indian Camp,"" ""The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife""; plays such as Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, Eugene O'Neill's A Long Days Journey into Night, or Athol Fugard's Master Harold...and the boys; poems such as Ken Mikolowski's ""michael/alternatives""; autobiographies such  as Philip Roth's Patrimony; and films such as Pat Conroy's The Great Santini, Elia Kazan's East of Eden, or Chris Eyre's Smoke Signals.  Students will write three papers plus a mid-semester and final exam. ","Cohen,Hubert I",RCHUMS,217,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

We’ll also pay close attention to short stories, and some other forms of storytelling, by a variety of modern masters. Some of our key artistic goals will be: achieving psychological realism, conveying emotion through detail and action, dramatizing rather than explaining, and persuasive world building.

Topics in World Dance,"Throughout the world, dance is often how people express their deepest cultural and spiritual values. Dance can mark life events, including birth, adolescence, marriage, and even death. It can affirm group solidarity or be a political statement. It can be introspective or warlike. In Embodied Contemplations: Expression and Understanding through World Dance we will explore ethnic, recreational, and theatrical examples to learn to look at dance with an informed aesthetic perspective and a deeper cultural understanding. Dances from India, New Zealand, Cambodia, Turkey, Mexico, South Africa, and the United States are among the movement styles we will study. Considerations range from what performers do with their bodies and how their movements relate to music to what has been the significance of these dances in their cultures and how they are changing in the digital age. Coursework will include a midterm and a final exam, a paper, and questions to ponder. No experience or knowledge of dance is needed for this course; all students from all fields are welcome and encouraged to attend. ","

We will ask questions like how does popular music work in the formation of identities for artists and audiences? How did the popular music sound, why did it sound that way, what can it tell us about the history of the period, and how did it change as the nation transformed? We will encounter theories on intercultural exchange, musicking, globalization, and explore popular music’s relationships with emotion, memory, identity, and politics in our discussion and analysis. The course includes a diverse array of source materials, including primary and secondary documents, sound recordings, music videos, films, and online multimedia.

Modern Art:  Avant-Garde to Contemporary,"

To quote Craig Damrauer:“Modern Art = I could do that + yeah, but you didn’t.” The course will survey twentieth-century art from Europe and the U.S. and investigate its novelty, profundity, and humor. We will cover the names you know (Picasso, Matisse, O’Keefe, Pollock) as well as works that you might not be so sure about (drip paintings, urinals, a woman hanging from the ceiling by a rope), all while developing a series of questions about the nature of art and its relationship to the social and political context from which it emerged.   Not only will this course provide an overview of the twentieth-century, Western art, it will equip you with the background necessary to begin to understand the art of the twenty-first.

Central European Cinema,"

During four decades of Communist Party rule, the film industries of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia were under state control. One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics; one serious drawback was the existence of a censorship apparatus which made criticism of the policies of the existing regimes very difficult (though not impossible). Nonetheless, in certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in East Central Europe were able to be more incisive, frank, and provocative than is generally possible within the profit-driven, entertainment-oriented Hollywood film industry. This is not to say that the Communist regimes themselves gave priority to ameliorating the living conditions of their ethnic minorities or of women. But talented and committed filmmakers were able to take advantage of the progressive official pronouncements of these regimes with regard to ethnic and gender issues in order to craft powerful films, films which the regimes had no grounds to suppress or censor.
This course will study some of the most important films made in four thematic categories:

the Holocaust — the reactions of people in East Central Europe to the genocidal plans of the Nazis, from indifference and collaboration to heroic acts of altruism
ethnic discrimination and its consequences in more recent years — the depressed economic status of the Roma (Gypsies); animosity among Croats, Serbs, Moslem Bosnians and Albanians, leading to Yugoslavia's past and present civil wars — as well as the countervailing examples of a commonality of humanistic values and peaceful coexistence among people of these ethnicities
women's lives under state socialism — women in the work force in large numbers, but plagued by a ""double"" or ""triple"" burden, with continued primary responsibility for domestic work and child care, as well as by persistent patriarchal attitudes toward sex and marriage in society as a whole
the response of Central Europe's leading women filmmakers, who, in different contexts and with different stylistic approaches, have presented heroines who rebel and struggle against the patriarchal order

We will view and discuss films from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia, and Macedonia dealing with the above issues. We also will give attention to the artistic structure of the films — how they go about transmitting their themes with power and emotion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and three short (5-6 page) papers; all students must write a paper for Unit I, and then for two of the remaining three units (the course is divided into four units).Class Format:All of the required films, readings, and lectures will be on-line, as will discussion preparation sessions.  Weekly short quizzes on the films and brief discussion questions will help students keep pace with the course.  One-on-one on-line conferences with the instructors, as well as small Zoom meetings on the suggested paper topics, will be arranged throughout the semester.  Feedback on papers before the required revisions on them will be conveyed via written comments and one-on-one meetings on-line.

Assignments and on-line quizzes will be asynchronous and ""open-book,"" in the sense that students will be able to review films and readings as they wish before responding.  Grades will be based primarily on three medium-length papers and revisions of the first two of these three papers.  Due dates for the papers and the revisions will be spread throughout the semester, with a paper or revision due every two or three weeks, beginning in the fourth week of the course.

This course will use Canvas for all asynchronous online components.  Synchronous meetings with the instructors will be conducted through Zoom.  These meetings will be optional except for discussions of revisions of papers, which will be required twice during the semester.  Such discussions will generally be brief, but may be longer if students are encountering particular difficulties.  Students should have access to a camera and a microphone on a computer or to a telephone.

Advanced Narration,"  The writer Katherine Anne Porter said, “Human life itself may be almost pure chaos, but the work of the artist—the only thing he’s good for—is to take these handfuls of confusion and disparate things, things that seem to be irreconcilable, and put them together in a frame to give them some kind of shape and meaning.” As a writer of short fiction, how do you craft your unique and original “frame”? How do professional writers learn to take risks in order to spot problems and possibilities in their work? How do writers portray Porter’s “confusion and disparate things” through a deliberate composition and revision process? In this fiction writing seminar, we’ll critique each other’s short stories in a class workshop devoted to the art and craft of the next draft. Class discussion and required written comments will explore fiction writing techniques to help shape what’s on the page while inviting the writer to bring more to her pages. We’ll also read short stories by a variety of contemporary authors doing what we all hope to do: write art.

Special Topics in the Humanities,"On April 15, 2019, severe fire nearly brought down the thirteenth-century Gothic cathedral that sits in the heart of Paris. In the following days, to the surprise of many and dismay of some, news coverage and monetary pledges devoted to the event and its aftermath surpassed those being given to urgent humanitarian and political problems. In this highly interdisciplinary course, students will be given the tools with which to understand the architectural, cultural, religious, and historical significance of the Notre-Dame cathedral within the larger context of medieval religious architecture and of French literature and history. They will also be invited to think more broadly about such varied topics as sacred space, urbanization, the birth of the university, medieval revivals in the modern era, and the enduring allure of Gothic architecture (as represented on this campus by the Law School quadrangle). In the final course unit, students will be invited to reflect on and assess the varied rebuilding proposals that were proposed in the months following the fire. The course will have substantial historical, art historical, medieval studies, literary, architectural, and religious studies components.","Burde,Mark",RCHUMS,334,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003," - Notre-Dame, Paris, Gothic Cathedrals, and Us",3,HU,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Special Topics in the Humanities,"In Jack Shaheen’s book, Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People (originally published 2001), he painstakingly analyzes the history of Hollywood films’ depictions of Arabs and Muslims. He noted the persistent conflation of Muslims and Arabs (despite the fact that only about 20% of the world’s Muslims are Arab), and depiction of these individuals as lascivious sheikhs, terrorists, seductive belly dancing harem girls, and oppressed people in need of a savior. This course does not seek to find redemption in Hollywood (as Evelyn Alsultany has noted in the introduction to her book Arabs and Muslims in the Media: Race and Representation After 9/11 the representation problem in Hollywood has persisted since the publication of Shaheen’s book), but rather turns to the Islamic world itself to find alternative self-representation in its contemporary cinema. This course will look at contemporary films from throughout the Islamic World including the Arab World, Iran, Turkey, and South and Southeast Asia, as well as those that address the Muslim experience in America. We will examine not only how these films challenge those conceptions of Muslims portrayed by Hollywood and mass media, but also how they respond to their particular socio-cultural contexts.  We will also investigate how elements like cinematography, editing, and music work together to create and articulate meaning in these various films. Students will develop skills in visual analysis, critical thinking, and academic writing. These skills will be honed and demonstrated through group work, in-class participation, serving as discussion lead for one class, an in-class presentation, and two writing assignments (an analysis of one film, and an argumentative paper about a topic in Contemporary film from the Islamic world of the student’s choice). No prior knowledge of the Islamic world or Film Studies required.","Crasnow,Sascha M",RCHUMS,334,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - Contemporary Film of the Islamic World,3,HU,,With permission of instructor.,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Special Topics in the Humanities,"Representations of Muslims that dominate in the West typically present two monolithic images—that of the terrorist and that of the victim (of either Islamist fundamentalism or Western warfare). It is rare that representations of Muslims by Muslims rise to prominence within the West that are not either framed as a “humanizing project” aimed at making Muslims more sympathetic or derided for reaffirming Islamophobic stereotypes in order to appeal to a Western audience. These flawed or incomplete representations can have real-life societal and political consequences—from interpersonal misunderstandings to impacting the formation of legislation and international policy. In this course, we will complicate and critique these depictions of Islam and Muslims by examining representations of Islam by Muslims and individuals from the Islamic world across diverse forms of contemporary cultural expression and consider the impact that more diverse representation can have on a local and global scale.","Crasnow,Sascha M",RCHUMS,334,"Winter 2022, ",Section 005, - Art and Music of the Islamic World,3,"RE, HU",,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Special Topics in the Humanities,"In honor of the hybrid theme, this class will be both a reading course and a workshop. Each week we will read examples of writing that falls between the genres of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, or blends two together in an experimental fashion; we will then write our own imitation of the form and share them with the group. How has the hybrid been used by writers historically to represent experiences and identities that fall between categories? How can the hybrid be used as a process to create something larger in collage, mosaic, or kaleidoscopic form? Everyone will be expected to write something new every week, and participate in peer workshops and class discussion. Each student will also complete a final project of linked pieces in your chosen sub-genre or multi-genres. We will explore historical work as well as recent publications, including writers like Claudia Rankine, Gertrude Stein, Victoria Chang, John D’Agata, Jenny Boully, Danez Smith, Maggie Nelson, Kazim Ali, Tung-Hui Hu, Sabrina Orah Mark, Western and Daoist Fables, and more.

Special Topics in the Humanities,"How has art developed in Palestine since the formation of the state of Israel? How do artists produce work under occupation? How has a notion of Palestinian art developed in a society that lacks statehood and is divided geographically both regionally and in diaspora? This course aims to explore these and related questions through an examination of Palestinian art production from 1948 to the present. Beginning with an overview of Palestinian art prior to 1948, the course then traces Palestinian art production within historic Palestine (present-day Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza) and the diaspora. We will look both chronologically and thematically at how artists have addressed issues such as exile, occupation, diaspora, and resistance over the last 70 years. Students will develop skills in visual analysis, critical thinking, and academic writing. These skills will be honed and demonstrated through group work, in-class participation, serving as discussion lead for one class, an in-class presentation, and two writing assignments (an analysis of one work, and an argumentative paper about a topic in Palestinian art of the student’s choice).

Theatre and Incarceration,"Artistic practice in prisons has occurred since the inception of prisons themselves, though popular thought tends not to connect the idea of the arts with that of criminal justice systems. This course surveys the history of performance in prisons through the examination of plays written by and about prisoners as well as narratives which chronicle the process of creating theatre in prisons. The course also interrogates various strategies for creating performances in prisons, questioning the utility and goals of each process of creation and seeking to identify those which are most sustainable and which best serve participants in the process.  Students will use some of these strategies in practice as they facilitate their workshops in prisons and juvenile detention centers.","Lucas,Ashley Elizabeth",RCHUMS,335,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,With permission of instructor.,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Shakespeare on the Stage,"This course adopts a ""text-to-performance"" approach to Shakespeare's plays, recognizing the Bard's dramatic works as great literature as well as dynamic scripts meant to be acted in front of rapt — and sometimes rowdy — audiences. In this course, we will read Shakespeare’s plays as literary scholars (examining plot, language, poetics, imagery, characterization, and historical context) while developing the actor’s craft of making the works come to life (exploring vocal delivery, movement, motivation, observation, and interpretation). Our in-depth study of four select plays, one from each of the major genres — comedy, tragedy, history, and romance — will include engaging in practical acting work on monologues and scenes in addition to ""de-coding"" Shakespeare's 450-year-old English. Abridged video screenings (and, if local opportunities arise, attending live theater) will supplement our study of performance and production choices. Written work will include short character and scene studies, close-readings, critiques, and a paper on staging a Shakespeare play. The course will culminate in a public performance of monologues and scenes prepared during the semester.","Becker,Audrey",RCHUMS,381,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,RCHUMS 280.,,May not be repeated for credit.

What did it mean in the past? How does this commitment vary across cultures? To what extent are our ideas about the life of an artist shaped by Hollywood? In the first half of “Living Art,” we will study self-portraits and profiles of artists in film, literature, and other media, with attention to the everyday intrusions—e.g. bias, material needs, physical limitations—onto the artist’s life. In the second half of the course, we will look at works of art (e.g. paintings, photographs, pottery, poetry) that engage with everyday life. Among other inquiries, we will consider how some everyday objects have become art while some works of art have been reproduced and commodified so often as to become everyday objects.

Special Topics,"This minicourse surveys the ecological, evolutionary, and cultural significance of trees.  Trees provide a foundation of microhabitats for many species.  They store huge amounts of carbon and planting trees is proposed as one way to capture carbon that is building up in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels (derived partly from forests of long ago).  Forests influence local and regional climate.  Recent discoveries reveal that trees communicate via underground connections and share resources. They can emit pheromones to warn each other of predators.  Trees are also a focus of environmental activism and community empowerment. We will cover these topics, drawing upon scientific literature and memoirs by individuals whose life work has involved trees, including multicultural perspectives.  Students will write commentaries on assigned readings, lead a discussion in class, and write a short research paper.  We will have opportunities to contribute to production of a play about Wangari Maatthai, the Kenyan activist who started the Green Belt Movement and won a Nobel Prize for her leadership.","Badgley,Catherine E",RCIDIV,351,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,2,,Minicourse,With permission of instructor.,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

This definition may be all the more appropriate given the explosion in the number of new decks during the last thirty years. There is perhaps no other ""story"" that has been so lavishly and diversely illustrated. Along with historical decks (e.g., the fifteenth-century Visconti-Sforza Tarot; the eighteenth-century Ancient Minchiate Fiorentine Tarot; the Tarot of Marseilles; the early twentieth-century Rider-Waite Tarot, probably the most famous and widely-used deck), there are modern Tarot decks based on literary themes and authors (e.g., Greek myths, Norse myths, Arthurian legends, the Oz stories, Alice in Wonderland, Shakespeare, Dante, Tolkien), artists and art movements (e.g., William Blake, Bosch, Dali, da Vinci, Disney, Art Nouveau, Manga, Hello Kitty), fantasy creatures (e.g., mermaids, goblins, dragons, fairies, unicorns, vampires), and cultural/religious groups (e.g., Native Americans, African Americans, Gypsies, Mexicans, Buddhists, Chinese).","Burkam,David Thomas",RCIDIV,351,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003, - The Tarot-A Visual Encyclopedia of the World's Archetypes,2,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Special Topics,"Almost every month, a new tell-all memoir hits the racks: a woman looks back on how she survived her rotten mother; a man remembers his struggles with drinking and drugs.  Such books have their place, but memoir can embrace a much broader palette of experiences—positive and negative—and take readers beyond the purely personal to a greater understanding of a place, a time, an event, and even themselves. For the writer, creating a memoir should be a way not only to relate and confront personal stories, but also to illuminate a part of the world.","Rosegrant,Susan Ruth",RCIDIV,351,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - Memoir: Writing from Within,2,,Minicourse,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Special Topics,"According to the UN Refugee Agency, 1 in every 110 people globally is either an asylum-seeker or a refugee. Many are fleeing violence and persecution, but increasingly, they are forced to leave due to the effects of climate change. Displacement and statelessness are pressing realties in our world today and how we respond to them is a measure of our humanity. By international law, everyone has the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution (Universal Declaration of Human Rights), and yet many world leaders are backpedaling on this legal commitment. Once this country prided itself on welcoming the “tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Too often, we declare the arrival of those in need to be a “national emergency” and want to build a wall to ward off the alleged invasion. We see threat instead of opportunity, “criminal aliens” instead of fellow human beings. Words and images matter: they influence hearts, minds, and policies. The refugees are not the crisis, but rather, the narratives we tell about them.","Goertz,Karein K",RCIDIV,351,"Winter 2022, ",Section 005, - Refugee Narratives,2,,Minicourse,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Environmental Activism: Citizenship in a Republic,"



There is a rich history of American environmental activism that accelerated in the 1960's and became widespread in the 1970's, spurred by an increasing awareness of the harmful effects of pollution on public health and the destructive effect of industrial activity on the planet.  The Santa Barbara oil spill off the coast of California and the widely-disseminated photos of the Cuyahoga River on fire near downtown Cleveland, Ohio had a profound effect on the American public. These jarring events and others led to an unprecedented wave of environmental lawmaking, spurred, in part, by the actions of the public.  At this time in our environmental policy-making and regulations, when so much seems dire, this course may offer a more pragmatic perspective on the battles of environmentalism. 

Environmental Activism will provide an understanding of the history of environmental activism in the United States, the social and cultural context of the environmental movement, and the tools for effective environmental activism.  Students will be exposed to a range of advocacy tools that have shaped the movement, as well as the organizations and individuals who have been leading proponents of meaningful environmental change.  Students will actively participate in the discussion of assigned readings and current environmental challenges and complete independent writing assignments, as well as an end-of-semester project that builds on the themes of the course and advocates on behalf of an issue or perspective using the tools identified throughout the semester.","Murphy,Virginia E",RCIDIV,390,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,It is best to have at least one environmental course prior to this class.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Sustainability and the Campus,"This “hands-on” interdisciplinary course explores sustainability in higher education generally and at the University of Michigan specifically in a dynamic, interactive way. Drawing upon theory and practice in sustainability, environmental management, organizational change and social advocacy, students conduct a substantial, hands-on group project in conjunction with a university sponsor. Past projects have led or helped lead to the creation of the “Welcome to Planet Blue” guide, the planting of a campus garden, formation of the UM Sustainability Foods Program, planning for a Waste-Free Big House and many other direct outcomes. Through guest lectures, discussions, simulations, lectures, and the group project, this course addresses the real-life challenges of campus environmental sustainability. The focus is on active, participation-based learning; students leave the course with an understanding of the campus as a lever for environmental change and with the personal tools to act as change agents. Beyond directly impacting the campus, this course helps develop professional skills in sustainability project management.","Soderstrom, Sara  ",RCIDIV,391,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,ID,Sustain,With permission of instructor.,"An introductory course in Environment, Earth, or related field (e.g., ENVIRON 110, 111, 201, 270).",,May not be repeated for credit.

Spanish Language Internship Project I,"The Spanish Language Internship Program aims to connect Spanish-speaking students with partnered community based organizations to provide unique service learning opportunities with the Latino community in Washtenaw County and Southwest Detroit area. Students commit to going to their site one day per week and volunteer 3 to 4 hours there at a time. By engaging themselves into their community service work, students gain insight into the culture, economic needs and a better understanding of the Spanish language. To compliment their learning, students attend and participate in Spanish discussion sessions to discuss their activities at their sites, share experiences, and have discussions based on readings related to Culture, Education, Immigration Reform, and other relevant issues impacting the Latino Population at large.

Students are required to keep Weekly Journal Logs in Spanish to reflect upon their experiences and weigh the significance of their observations. Journal entries are submitted via email once per week. They also are required to write a 4-5 page Midterm Research Paper in Spanish on a topic related to class discussions or of strong interest related to the Latino population at large. All topics must be pre-approved by the instructor. The proposal should do the following: (1) state the question to be explored; (2) identify one or more possible answers (i.e., hypotheses) and their relative merits; and (3) identify at least four sources used to frame and/or assess the hypotheses. At least one source should be a scholarly book, a scholarly article, and only one source can come from the resources available on Ctools. They must write a 4-5 page Final Reflection Paper written in Spanish due on the day of the last discussion session. The paper should reflect on their entire semester based on what they learned from interacting with the Latino community, their overall experiences of weekly field trips, and class discussions.

In this seminar we will use the 2007 Historical Memory Law and the 2021 Law of Democratic Memory to explore some of the most significant social and cultural processes in Spain as it contends with the memory of the divisive past rooted in the Civil War and Franco’s dictatorial regime and contests the official narrative of a successful political transition to democracy. We will also delve in the terrorist violence perpetrated afterwards in the democratic years by the Basque group ETA and the peace process initiated in 2011 with its cessation of violence. We will focus on how the negotiations between the national desire to forget a painful history and the need to preserve its memory manifest themselves in music, films and other artistic expressions. Special emphasis will be given to the experience of exile, silence and displacement of the older generations, and the controversial burial sites of victims and perpetrators; the interplay of fear and power counterbalanced by movements of peaceful resistance. We will debate the role of monuments, memorials and public spaces as sites to preserve, forget or write alternative narratives that shed light on the contradictory experiences of collective trauma as well as the possible paths to reconciliation.

Readings in Spanish,"There is a general consensus that the process of Globalization is the most important social, political and economic tool in current times. According to the most powerful organizations in the world, Globalization is the best and only option for rich and poor countries to improve societies and solve a number of problems like poverty, social inequality and environmental depletion. Globalization was also considered the most effective model to provide new forms of economic progress and social inclusion for communities usually suffering from ostracism, like indigenous communities. However, after 20 years of radical changes oriented for free market ideology (privatizations, trade agreements, market consolidation, etc.) around the world, a number of social movements have emerged with a common goal: to diminish or change the effects of globalization in their societies. The present course is focused on understanding the process of Globalization, its benefits and downsides in Latin America, with special focus of the effects on indigenous communities. Thus, social movements and organizations from Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico and Colombia will be analyzed in order to estimate the new situation faced by indigenous populations. At the same time, the class will review literature on different forms of political participation in the Globalization and its effects. Documentaries will complement readings and final evaluation will be based on student participation, three academic papers and a class presentation.","Espinoza-Pino,Cristhian Carlo",RCLANG,324,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - Indigenous Activism in the Age of Globalization,4,,,With permission of instructor.,Proficiency test.,,May be repeated for credit.

Students will be introduced to four broad strategies used by social scientists: archival research; ethnography & fieldwork; survey research & quantitative methods, and oral histories. We will address both the theory and application of particular methodologies with a focus on finding effective approaches to explore pressing questions. Specifically, we will examine and utilize these methodologies to investigate the topic of the Social Crises of Labor. Examples considered in class will offer insights into the conditions of labor in the United States and around the globe and the ways that political conflicts and structural inequalities have produced multiple intersecting crises for labor and workers. We will also examine critical vantages revealed by interdisciplinary research as well as scholarship that foregrounds the inclusion of underrepresented voices and perspectives.

The Built Environment: Introduction to Landscape Change,"
 

This course provides a forum for the critical examination of  
human-built spaces and their relationship to the natural environment.   

It facilitates an inquiry around two basic sets of questions:

For any given site, what are its features, functions, and history; how does it act on its natural surroundings, and with what natural constraints?

At a broader level, how do we understand the boundary between the ""built"" and ""natural""; in what ways does this line blur, and how have these meanings changed over time?

Over the course of the academic term, students will develop a conceptual vocabulary for tackling these questions — a language for examining and expressing with precision and subtlety what is happening in our built environment.  Ultimately, students should gain a richer understanding of the term ""environment"" itself.

We will take a multi-faceted approach to this work.Course Requirements:The core work of the course is students' reading, reflecting, and sharing their insights in a variety of formats. Students are expected to:


 engage in class discussion in an informed and thoughtful way; 
write five brief essays (about 2 pages each) reflecting on a particular day's assigned reading; 
edit, revise, and expand the short essays into a single 10- to 12-page final paper; 
make a 10-minute oral presentation to the class on a site of the student's choosing (some students will substitute a paper for this assignment); 
prepare an illustrated analysis of a built environment on campus, using photos and/or drawings and short passages of text.
Intended Audience:Sophomores and Juniors in the Program in the Environment, or elsewhere in LSA. The course should appeal both to students interested in environmental literacy generally, and to those following specific environmental career tracks.Class Format:Class sessions will include lively discussion, small-group exercises, student presentations, and brief lectures.","D'Anieri,Philip James",RCSSCI,350,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, ID",Sustain,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Social Science Junior Seminar,"What does/can/should an egalitarian metropolis look like? And how does a focus on Detroit allow us to ask and answer these conceptual -- and practical -- questions in ways that draw on a variety of disciplines including architecture, history, urban planning, and the urban humanities? This course offers an interdisciplinary perspective on urban studies, urban design and the ways that concerns around social justice and equity can influence how we think about cities in the past, present and future. Drawing on a range of faculty expertise in LSA and Taubman, this team-taught course also incorporates the voices of practitioners and community members involved in current attempts to revitalize Detroit and “Detroit-like” cities in the United States and   elsewhere. By “Detroit-like cities” we mean urban areas that have experienced negative population growth, deindustrialization, economic disinvestment, racial stratification, environmental injustices and concomitant crises in housing, health care, policing, criminalization, and education. At the same time, Detroit and Detroit-like cities offer opportunities to conjoin critical humanistic inquiry, urban design, and policy solutions for building more equitable and sustainable cities.",,RCSSCI,360,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003," - Egalitarian Metropolis: Urban Studies, Urban Design & Social Justice in Detroit",3,SS,,,Upperclass standing.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

Social Science Junior Seminar,"The United States is a deeply unequal society divided and segregated along lines of race despite supposed guarantees to legal equality and appeals to colorblindness. This course will take a critical look at this tension in American law and society and consider the active role of law in constructing and maintaining racial categories, inequality, and segregation in the late nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States. We will examine major developments in the relationship between race and law since the end of the Civil War, placing contemporary crises of criminalization, incarceration, immigration enforcement, and disenfranchisement in deep historical context. These major developments include the transformation of criminal justice and law enforcement during Reconstruction, the construction of the Jim Crow regime, the role of racism in transforming ideas about criminality in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the roles of criminalization, policing, and incarceration in US colonialism and imperial expansion, immigration restriction and control, the criminalization of social movements and other forms of protest, and the racialization of the Wars on Crime and Drugs. We will use theoretical frameworks from multiple disciplines to understand these developments, including Critical Race Theory, racial formation, and relational racialization. We will also consider the roles of race and law in shaping various other axes of power over time, including gender, labor, citizenship, and empire. Over the course of the term, we will aim to excavate a usable past that can inform and shape current movements for justice, restoration, and equality.","Krinitsky,Nora",RCSSCI,360,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - Histories of Race and Law,3,SS,,,Upperclass standing.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

Social Science Junior Seminar,"As rallies and vigils to protest systemic racism swept across the United States in the summer of 2020, cities like Chicago, Oakland, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. saw a surge in interfaith demonstrations. Wearing hijabs, crucifixes, clerical collars, and prayer shawls, groups of participants from different religious traditions prayed and marched together for an end to racist acts of violence and disenfranchisement against Black Americans. One young demonstrator at a June protest in Chicago held a sign aloft reading “Justice, justice shall you pursue! Deuteronomy 16:18-20,” written in English and Hebrew. These demonstrations are not surprising, as interfaith organizing is a powerful yet underestimated force for social justice within communities in the United States. For the past century, interfaith groups have organized for causes like LGBTQ+ liberation, climate and economic justice, the #MeToo movement, abolition of capital punishment, and an end to the U.S.’s armed conflicts abroad. Even though religion is so often assumed to divide people into separate, isolated groups, in this class we will explore how interfaith groups have influenced collective organizing around deeply-important issues like antiracism, police reform, mass incarceration, and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hollenbach,Benjamin",RCSSCI,360,"Winter 2022, ",Section 010,,3,SS,,,Upperclass standing.,,May be repeated for a maximum of 12 credit(s).

Natural Disasters in East Asia,"In recent years, the world has come to witness what appears to be an unprecedented level of destruction caused by a series of devastating natural disasters that have leveled entire cities, taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and displaced even more. Stoking the popular imagination with dramatic images, the global media has come to depict hurricane Katrina, the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and most recently the tsunami that hit northeastern Japan as the work of an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and essentially chaotic force. Although true in some respects, this way of understanding earthquakes, tsunamis, and other events tend to obscure the social, political, and historical side of these so-called “natural” disasters. When, in fact, did we begin to regard these events as the work of “nature” as opposed to, say, God or some other supernatural agency? On what basis do we classify a certain event as a “natural” disaster? Can we ignore the influence of class, ethnicity, education, and power on the making and outcome of these disasters? This course will bring these and other questions to bear on the historical and comparative study of natural disasters in East Asia and elsewhere. Some background in the history and culture of East Asia is recommended.","Ahn,Juhn Young",RCSSCI,371,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, SS",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Among other things, we will study modern print media, ranging from poster art to publishing projects such as the magazine USSR in Construction, but also such domains that display distinct visual aspects without necessarily being prime foci of visual culture, e.g., the culture of festivities and visual aspects of the public space. We will also discuss profiles of artists who were active in forging the bridge between the avant-garde and political art (Klucis, Lissitski, Rodchenko). Time permitting, some of these domains will be compared— and contrasted— with similar phenomena in interwar Germany, especially as regards the culture of photo-illustrated magazines and book covers, visual aspects of the public space, or the cult of personality.

"Death, Immortality, and Afterlife","“What makes us human?” We may think that it is our ability to use language, or our capacity for abstract thinking, making history, crafting art, and developing religions, or is it our cognitive facility to conceptualize death and immortality? This course aims to answer these questions by resorting to the long and distant past, known as deep history, that spans from the prehistorical to the present. Realizing that this question goes beyond the capacity of any single academic discipline, we turn to history, cultural anthropology, archaeology, palaeontology, developmental psychology, comparative religions, art, and literature to explore the universal human search for the meaning of death and immortality. Cultural practices around death and immortality, like burial and mortuary rituals and telling stories about the afterlife, have marked the human experience since the emergence of homo sapiens. This course maps such practices to probe into the uniqueness of human beings compared to our closest hominid ancestors, especially the Neanderthals, to ask if they also have ritual burials, and if they so, how does this change our definition of being human. We then turn to the beginnings of the religious expression in prehistory leading to the foundations of the world’s major religions. Finally, we end by exploring how present communities imagine, negotiate, and ritualize the deaths of the living and the lives of the dead.","Al-Rustom,Hakem Amer",RELIGION,209,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,ID,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Where did it come from? What does it teach? What does it mean to be a Zen Buddhist? In this course we will look at the Zen tradition from a variety of perspectives. We will begin by familiarizing ourselves with some of the most common features of the tradition: dharma transmission, the lives of eminent monks, meditation, and koans—especially as these things are represented from within the tradition itself. From this foundation we will take a more critical look at the historical and philosophical development of Zen as it spread throughout East Asia.  Taking broader cultural contexts into account, we will re-examine some of the previous themes in light of recent scholarship on Zen. This course will also introduce students to the various forms Zen has taken in the ancient and modern world.

The Mediterranean: History and Culture,"In the year 1492, we all know that ""Columbus sailed the ocean blue""—but that is not all that happened! It was also a year of critical shifts that affected the history of the Mediterranean Sea. 1492 was the year that the Christian armies conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in the Iberian Peninsula. It was the year the first grammar of the Spanish language was published. It was also the year that the Catholic Monarchs, Fernando, and Isabel, expelled all of the Jews from the Peninsula, forcing them to resettle across the Mediterranean. When Columbus arrived in the Americas, the medieval world was already undergoing radical changes that would transform it forever, giving way to Early Modern Spanish culture and the beginnings of the Spanish empire and the Spanish language. This course will explore the meaning of 1492 for Spanish literature, art, film, and culture, including the foundation of Spanish grammar and the foundations of Spain as a global power. It will look at the legend of Boabdil, the last Muslim ruler who surrendered the Alhambra in Granada. It will read early writing about the voyage of Columbus to the Americas. And it will explore the importance of 1492 for Jewish culture, as the Jews relocated to other Mediterranean and Atlantic lands but preserved many aspects of Spanish culture and language. This course will explore how in 1492, entire worlds were made and unmade, and Spain itself was born as a power that would rule from the Mediterranean to the Pacific.","Szpiech, Ryan  ",ROMLANG,253,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - 1492 and the Mediterranean,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Sport in Russia,"

In the last fifty years, Russian sport has risen to world domination, especially in the Olympic Games, where Soviet athletes were preeminent in so many areas, then fallen into apparently terminal decline, but then risen again.  Thus, in the last fifteen years, Russia has again emerged as a major sporting presence and has used international sport as part of its “soft-power” approach to foreign affairs.  First Russia hosted the Champions League final, soccer’s biggest club match, in 2008; then Russia hosted the 2014 Olympic Games; later that year, Sochi, the Olympic city, hosted Russia’s first Formula One Grand Prix since 1914, and the race is now an annual F1 fixture; in 2018, Russia hosted—very successfully—by far the biggest single-sport event in the world: FIFA’s World Cup. And after a decade of decline and failure, Russian professional sports and Russian athletes are also once again prominent and successful. Yet Russia continues to play by its own rules, as the massive scandal over what appears to be government-supported doping in Olympic sports reveals.
What is the story of sport in Russia? How did modern, organized sport emerge and what was there before that imported word спорт (sport) entered the Russian language, along with all that influence from abroad?  What was the Russian sporting world like before the Soviet period, how did emergent modern sport look like at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries?  How was sport transformed after the Bolshevik Revolution, and then again during Stalinism?  What happened after the Second World War?  What made Soviet sport so successful internationally in the post-war period; what did this have to do with the sports and games pursued by ordinary people in the Soviet Union; how did people look at the sporting success of the USSR?  What caused the decline of organized sport in the late Soviet and early post-Soviet periods, what has propelled the revival; what are the favored recreational sports of Russians today; what is the role of spectator sports and recreational sports in modern Russian society? What caused the decline of organized sport in the late Soviet and early post-Soviet periods, what has propelled the revival; what are the favored recreational sports of Russians today; what is the role of spectator sports and recreational sports in modern Russian society?
And, more important, what is the relationship between sport and society; how has that ever-explosive mixture of sport and politics looked in Russia and the Soviet Union; what questions of gender and nationality are raised— or elided— by sport in Russia; has sport merely reflected social history, or, perhaps, shaped it; what has been the role of sport in shaping ideas about the Soviet Union, Russia, and Russians within and beyond the country?
This course will try to answer those questions by looking at very diverse material, including belles lettres, scholarship, personal testimony, journalism, and records of sporting events.  Students will, in studying through the lens of sport the culture, political and social life, and history of one of the world’s most important countries, not only acquire a solid knowledge of that country today, but will also develop the analytical skills necessary to explore in-depth complex and intriguing cultural, social, political, and historical issues.Course Requirements:Written assignments for the course are: three papers; three online writing assignments; and a weekly journal.","Makin,Michael",RUSSIAN,333,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,"ULWR, HU",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

"The Icelandic Sagas: Vikings, Women, and Vengeance","
The Icelandic Sagas are unique literary documents from medieval Iceland. They inform us about the cultural, political, and religious currents of land in tumult and transition. Unlike many contemporary texts, these are not inherently moralistic or celebratory  —  instead they are dark, matter-of-fact inquiries into the way individuals respond to often unresolvable situations. In this course, we will encounter vindictive women, treacherous kings, heroes and anti-heroes, lawyers, berserkers, and poets.

"Programs, Information and People","Introduction to programming with a focus on applications in informatics. Covers the
fundamental elements of a modern programming language and how to access data on the
Internet. Explores how humans and technology complement one another, including
techniques used to coordinate groups of people working together on software development.

This course is the first in a two-course sequence introducing students to programming and
the culture of programming, with a focus on applications for people, by people, and about
people. For people means applications for end-users or analysts, as opposed to back-end
or infrastructure software. By and about people refers to processing data traces of people’s
actions and interactions.

Detailed Learning Objectives. 
At the end of this course, students should be able to:

 Discuss the ways that people and computers are the same and ways that they are
different as information processors
 Describe how open source software projects are typically organized and some of the
advantages and disadvantages of that organizational form
 Describe the relationship between redundancy and compression
 Understand the following programming concepts:
     
 Data types
       Variables
       Functions
       Conditional statements
       Iteration
       List and dictionary data structures
       List comprehensions
       Regular expressions
       APIs
     
  Write programs in python that demonstrate understanding of all of the above
concepts and that use the following features:
     
 File operations
      String processing operations
      External modules and APIs
     
  Manipulate data to:
     
Extract and summarize desired elements
      Output the processed data in .csv formats
     
  Create a test suite for a simple program

Textbooks and Notes.
We will be using a custom version of the interactive, online textbook below. I will be
editing and reorganizing it to fit our curriculum. But you can get a sense for it now.

Other Required Readings


Christian, B., The Most Human Human, 2011, London, England: Viking.
Weber, S. The Success of Open Source, 2005, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press
Course Requirements:Assignments
There will be assignments throughout the course (pretty much every week and sometimes
mini exercises during a lecture). Regular assignments allow you to learn the material in
small ""chunks"" and to keep a close eye on how well you understand the material. In some
cases, we will do part or all of the assignments during a lecture, though you will submit it
later.
Exams
There will be a midterm and a final exam. The midterm exam is administered during the
regular lecture session and the final during the final exam period. The exam dates are
announced well in advance (see the dates at the end of this document). If you have a
conflict, please let me know at least 2 weeks in advance so that I can arrange a different
time for you.
Class Participation (Bonus Points)
Class participation, helping others, interacting on the Q&A site and answering questions,
asking good questions that lead to interesting discussions, and pointing out corrections to
my lectures or code will contribute to bonus points, which you can use to help boost your
grade.
Python Challenge
There are optional challenge problems at www.pythonchallenge.com. I encourage
you to try to solve the problems there when you have time and discuss approaches or even
code on the email list —  that all contributes to class participation points. If you are not able to
solve them initially, don’t worry. Treat them as optional and a fun part of the course. The
good thing about the Python challenges is that once you submit a solution to a challenge,
you can see several solutions to the previous challenge. It is a learning experience to see
how other people approached the same problem.

Grading
The graded work in the course will be weighted roughly as follows to determine a final
percentage grade. (Note that bonus points could allow you to get above 100%):

Weekly Assignments 30%
Class prep (online exercises) 10%
Discussion section prep and participation 5%
Exams: 40% (Midterm: 15% and
Final: 25%)

Capstone project: 15%
Helping other students: (helpful questions or answers in lecture
or on Facebook group)
Up to 2% bonus points
Intended Audience:The course is designed for students with no programming experience. If you stick with the
course and invest the necessary time, you will be amazed at how much you will learn in 14
weeks. Don’t be intimidated by the few students who already know how to program.
They’re welcome in the course, but the course is not designed for them.

If you do not have any programming experience, some concepts will take some time to sink
in.Class Format:We will be using a partially “flipped” classroom. It is expected that you will read and attempt
exercises before class. To do this well, you will generally need to allocate about 2 hours of
prep time before each lecture session.

During the official lecture time, we will review tricky points and difficult exercises, solve
some more additional problems together, have supervised time working individually on the
graded homework, and get a preview of the next session’s material.
During the section meetings, you will discuss the non-programming readings (Most Human
Human; Success of Open Source) and occasionally have more supervised time working
individually on the graded homework. You will need to allocate about 1 hour of reading time
each week.

If you are doing the 4 hours of prep time weekly, you will often be able to complete the
graded homeworks in class, or with 1-2 additional hours outside of class. If you don’t do the
prep before class, you will lose much of the benefit of the class time, and will end up
spending more total time trying to catch up in order to do the homework. You will also lose
the points for prep, so it will hurt your grade directly.","van Lent, Colleen  ",SI,106,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,MSA,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to Information Studies,"Are we in the midst of an Information Revolution? Is the Information Age essentially different from other periods in history and if so, how? What role does Information, and the myriad systems for processing and disseminating Information, play in individual lives, or in society as a whole? How can we build effective Information Systems to accomplish important goals such as facilitating commerce, fostering civic participation, and supporting human relationships? This course will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to begin to address the key issues associated with Information and its impact on human lives. Issues will range from the theoretical (what is Information, and how do humans construct it?), to the cultural (is life on the screen a qualitatively different phenomenon from experiences with earlier distance-shrinking and knowledge-building technologies such as telephones?), to the practical (what are the basic architectures of computing and networks?). Successful completion of this ""gateway"" course will give you the conceptual tools necessary to understand the politics, economics, and culture of the Information Age, providing a foundation for later study in Information or a valuable complement to studies in other disciplines.","Wallace,David A",SI,110,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Ethics and Information Technology,"This course explores the ethical dilemmas that exist where human beings, information objects, and information systems interact. The course introduces students to a variety of ethical models from historical and cross-cultural perspectives and then explores the relevance of these models to a variety of new and emerging technologies that are inherently social in their construction and use. Initial examples of issues that the course covers include interpersonal engagement through online games and virtual environments, maintaining the integrity of digital content in a networked world, and balancing trade offs between secrecy (security) and openness of code, data, and information systems. Students explore the technological underpinnings of associated technology systems, experiment with individual and group interaction with technologies, and examine the mechanics of ethical and unethical behaviors.","Pasquetto,Irene",SI,410,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,ULWR,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation,"Any product—whether a website, a technological system, or an electronically mediated service—benefits from
evaluation before, during, and after the development cycle. Too often, the people who use a product cannot find
what they want or accomplish what they need to do. Products are more successful when they are developed through
a process that identifies how the products will be used, elicits input from potential users, and watches how the
products function in real time with real users. This course provides a hands-on introduction to methods used
throughout the entire evaluation process—from identifying the goals of the product, picturing who will use it,
engaging users through a variety of formative evaluation techniques, and confirming a product’s function through
usability testing and summative evaluation. Specific methods include personas and scenarios, competitive analysis,
observation, surveys, interviews, data analysis, heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and task analysis. Students
will work on group projects that apply these techniques to real products in use or development.

Goals of the Course

In this course, you will learn how to evaluate interactive software products—focusing on social computing services
—through hands-on experience with a range of methods and design issues, including: Comparison of the features
and usability of your system with the competition (competitive analysis) In-depth analysis of user needs
(observation and ethnographic methods) Asking users about their opinions and experiences (interviews and surveys)
Embodying a set of target users and what they would want to do with the system (personas and scenarios) Using
checklists and “heuristics” to evaluate the system from several points of view (heuristic evaluation, cognitive
walkthroughs, card sorting) Doing user testing of typical tasks on the system (usability testing) Improving details of
the user interface (design considerations) Monitoring and testing the design of a system after release to the public
(experiments, log analysis) Working with a larger development team (real world issues) This course integrates
learning and doing. I will give you background on the methods (through reading), teach the methods (in class), have
you try them out (in class or on your own), and you will apply these techniques to practice projects with your
classmates. For many of the methods, you will turn in a report styled like the ones given directly to developers. This
way you learn to write the reports in a way that is most useful in your future career. As you learn about these
methods, you will have opportunities to reflect on the appropriate circumstances for using each of them.","Marcu,Gabriela",SI,422,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

—through hands-on experience with a range of methods and design issues, including: Comparison of the features
and usability of your system with the competition (competitive analysis) In-depth analysis of user needs
(observation and ethnographic methods) Asking users about their opinions and experiences (interviews and surveys)
Embodying a set of target users and what they would want to do with the system (personas and scenarios) Using
checklists and “heuristics” to evaluate the system from several points of view (heuristic evaluation, cognitive
walkthroughs, card sorting) Doing user testing of typical tasks on the system (usability testing) Improving details of
the user interface (design considerations) Monitoring and testing the design of a system after release to the public
(experiments, log analysis) Working with a larger development team (real world issues) This course integrates
learning and doing. I will give you background on the methods (through reading), teach the methods (in class), have
you try them out (in class or on your own), and you will apply these techniques to practice projects with your
classmates. For many of the methods, you will turn in a report styled like the ones given directly to developers. This
way you learn to write the reports in a way that is most useful in your future career. As you learn about these
methods, you will have opportunities to reflect on the appropriate circumstances for using each of them.","Marcu,Gabriela",SI,422,"Winter 2022, ",Section 101,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
First Year Seminar,"


This course is designed to introduce students to the history and culture of the Roma in Central and Eastern Europe, with special focus on the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary. Special attention is given to the issues related to the contemporary situation of the Roma: assimilation and marginalization of the Roma minority, economic problems, housing, education, and healthcare. The course also examines the socio-cultural stereotypes that shape the European dominant population’s attitudes towards the Roma minority.","Pasek, Ewa Maria",SLAVIC,150,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Gipsy Kings?!

Arts and Cultures of Central Europe,"Central Europe belongs to those unique historical amalgams whose composition defies disciplinary boundaries. The course traces this region’s complex history, culture, and its current spirit. Central European literature, theater, film, and visual art will be examined against the background of the tumultuous and often tragic events which left marks on the culture of Austrians, Czechs, and Germans during the 20th century. Symbiosis of these ethnic groups and their linguistic diversity will be discussed. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of Jewish culture in Central Europe. Jewish emancipation, disappearance of ghettoes, but also antisemitism and the Holocaust are among the topics. Another topic is the resistance against the Communist order and its eventual disintegration in 1989 as documented by works inspired by the fall of the Berlin wall. Authors to be read include Prague’s Jewish legends, Hašek’s Švejk, Kafka’s Trial, Kundera’s Joke, J. Roth’s Bust of the Emperor; films include Wegener’s Golem, Hippler’s Eternal Jew, Forman’s Firemen’s Ball, and Becker’s Goodbye, Lenin.","Toman,Jindrich",SLAVIC,225,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Czech, German Jewish",3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Studies in Eastern European Cultures,"This course will explore the complicated dynamics between popular culture and politics in Poland during the last two decades of communism. Did the alternative rock culture undermine and destroy the communist government? Did the prominent bands (Maanam, Republika, Prefekt) express the general mood of the population, which was ready to attack the existing political structure? Did the communist government “look the other way” and tolerate subversive activities of music, cabaret, and film artists sensing its own inability to control the course of events? Lyrics and performances by rock bands, cartoons, texts by stand-up comedians, children’s films, and graffiti will be studied and analyzed.","Westwalewicz,Piotr Antoni",SLAVIC,290,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Rock Kills Communism,1,HU,Minicourse,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

Studies in Eastern European Cultures,"The folk tale (skazka) is one of the most popular and productive forms of verbal folklore in Russia, with an enormous range of narratives, characters, and situations. Folk tales reveal many aspects of traditional Russian folk life, from ancient beliefs to daily practices, and reflect key preoccupations of the Russian peasantry. This course introduces students to a wide selection of Russian animal, domestic, magic/fairy/wonder tales; explores the magic world of the Russian folktale, its language, plot structure and hidden symbolism as a genre of popular verbal narrative; examines the history of the collection and study of folk tales; and studies the aesthetic, social, cultural and psychological values they reflect.","Makin,Alina Udalchenko",SLAVIC,290,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - The Magic World of the Russian Folk Tale,1,HU,Minicourse,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

In our class we will discuss the original text and its various screen adaptations, trying to understand how a sad story of a humble Jewish dairyman from a Ukrainian village at the turn of the twentieth century has become a heart-warming musical hit with a universal appeal. This class is offered in conjunction with the new UMS concert production of Fiddler on the Roof which will be performed at Hill Auditorium on February 19 and 20, 2022.

Studies in Eastern European Cultures,"Have you ever heard the words “schmooze,” “glitch,” or “kvetch”? These words entered English from Yiddish, the daily language of east European Jews. But Jews have spoken many other languages as well, including Hebrew, Aramaic, and Jewish versions of Arabic, Italian, and Spanish. As one historian put it, “one language was never enough for the Jews.” In this class, we will explore the fascinating role of languages in Jewish culture and history. Analyzing diverse materials from Passover Haggadahs to popular Netflix shows  Unorthodox  and  Shtisel, students will learn how, when, and why Jews have used different languages. Among our topics will be code-switching and the role of languages in ideological debates about topics such as Zionism, religion, and Holocaust memory.

Central European Cinema,"

During four decades of Communist Party rule, the film industries of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia were under state control. One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics; one serious drawback was the existence of a censorship apparatus which made criticism of the policies of the existing regimes very difficult (though not impossible). Nonetheless, in certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in East Central Europe were able to be more incisive, frank, and provocative than is generally possible within the profit-driven, entertainment-oriented Hollywood film industry. This is not to say that the Communist regimes themselves gave priority to ameliorating the living conditions of their ethnic minorities or of women. But talented and committed filmmakers were able to take advantage of the progressive official pronouncements of these regimes with regard to ethnic and gender issues in order to craft powerful films, films which the regimes had no grounds to suppress or censor.
This course will study some of the most important films made in four thematic categories:

the Holocaust — the reactions of people in East Central Europe to the genocidal plans of the Nazis, from indifference and collaboration to heroic acts of altruism
ethnic discrimination and its consequences in more recent years — the depressed economic status of the Roma (Gypsies); animosity among Croats, Serbs, Moslem Bosnians and Albanians, leading to Yugoslavia's past and present civil wars — as well as the countervailing examples of a commonality of humanistic values and peaceful coexistence among people of these ethnicities
women's lives under state socialism — women in the work force in large numbers, but plagued by a ""double"" or ""triple"" burden, with continued primary responsibility for domestic work and child care, as well as by persistent patriarchal attitudes toward sex and marriage in society as a whole
the response of Central Europe's leading women filmmakers, who, in different contexts and with different stylistic approaches, have presented heroines who rebel and struggle against the patriarchal order

We will view and discuss films from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia, and Macedonia dealing with the above issues. We also will give attention to the artistic structure of the films — how they go about transmitting their themes with power and emotion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and three short (5-6 page) papers; all students must write a paper for Unit I, and then for two of the remaining three units (the course is divided into four units).Class Format:All of the required films, readings, and lectures will be on-line, as will discussion preparation sessions.  Weekly short quizzes on the films and brief discussion questions will help students keep pace with the course.  One-on-one on-line conferences with the instructors, as well as small Zoom meetings on the suggested paper topics, will be arranged throughout the semester.  Feedback on papers before the required revisions on them will be conveyed via written comments and one-on-one meetings on-line.

Assignments and on-line quizzes will be asynchronous and ""open-book,"" in the sense that students will be able to review films and readings as they wish before responding.  Grades will be based primarily on three medium-length papers and revisions of the first two of these three papers.  Due dates for the papers and the revisions will be spread throughout the semester, with a paper or revision due every two or three weeks, beginning in the fourth week of the course.

This course will use Canvas for all asynchronous online components.  Synchronous meetings with the instructors will be conducted through Zoom.  These meetings will be optional except for discussions of revisions of papers, which will be required twice during the semester.  Such discussions will generally be brief, but may be longer if students are encountering particular difficulties.  Students should have access to a camera and a microphone on a computer or to a telephone.

The Cold War was said to be a battle between the forces of ""Communism"" and ""Capitalism."" But what do these ideologically-loaded categories look like in practice? This course explores Communist and Capitalist economic and political systems as they played out in East Central Europe (1945 to the present), focusing on  people's daily lives, their material culture, their understanding of their rights as citizens, and their political position between East and West.   Students will follow two countries from the region throughout the course.

"Topics in Cultural Studies of Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe","The course focuses on interfaces of Soviet visual arts and related domains, including political propaganda, that characterizes the years of Revolution, the NEP Period, and Stalinism in the USSR, i.e., the years between the revolutions of 1917 and Stalin’s death in 1953. Among other things, we will study modern print media, ranging from poster art to publishing projects such as the magazine USSR in Construction, but also such domains that display distinct visual aspects without necessarily being prime foci of visual culture, e.g., the culture of festivities and visual aspects of the public space. We will also discuss profiles of artists who were active in forging the bridge between the avant-garde and political art (Klucis, Lissitski, Rodchenko). Time permitting, some of these domains will be compared— and contrasted— with similar phenomena in interwar Germany, especially as regards the culture of photo-illustrated magazines and book covers, visual aspects of the public space, or the cult of personality. Western contributions to Soviet visual culture will also be discussed.","Toman,Jindrich",SLAVIC,470,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Soviet Visual Culture: 1917-1953,3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 9 credit(s).

Meets with “Czech Vocal Literature,” taught under Voice Literature 504/388 in the School of Music, Theatre & Dance. While the School of Music aspect of the course is open to piano and voice students whose focus is performance, “Czech Poetry in Song” is open to non-music majors and the focus is on Czech cultural history, poetry, and what happens when that poetry is set to music. An overview of Czech poetry may include texts from the Kralice Bible, the Dvur Králové “manuscript,” folk texts, and poetry by Hálek, Sládek, Hejduk, Carek, Nezval, Seifert, and others, as set by Czech composers that include Smetana, Dvorák, Suk, Janácek, Martinu, Haas, Ježek, Kaprálová, and Eben. 

All songs will be performed in class in the original Czech by music majors, and English translations will be provided ahead of time for the class. 

There is also the opportunity to hone Czech pronunciation skills as these issues are addressed throughout the course.Course Requirements:Assignments include short presentations on poets, and a final paper on one assigned song setting (a recording of the song will be on reserve): When music is joined with poetry, a new art form is created—has the composer’s setting of the poem illuminated the poetry in any way for you? Why? Did your impression of the poem on first reading differ from when you heard the composer’s setting? Did the composer alter the original words? If so, what was the result? How does the song reflect Czech culture at the time it was written? Etc.Intended Audience:
No previous knowledge of Czech is required.

Introduction to Sociology:  Special Topics,"Sports are an important part of modern society worldwide, an idea which was reinforced by their seeming absence during the early months of the COVID pandemic and the recently lifted limitations on in-person attendance. Major sporting events such as the Olympics, the FIFA (soccer) World Cup, the Super Bowl, just to name a few, will draw tens of thousands of spectators and are often viewed by hundreds of millions of interested viewers. The most successful sports teams develop fan bases that expand beyond regional boundaries. This massive popularity also helps to reveal a variety of social problems that often become more visible at the intersections of sports and society. In this course we will consider why sports are so popular and ultimately important within society? We will also explore some of the roots of the social problems that are visible within sports and sporting cultures using sociological analysis and focusing primarily on sports in the United States.","Ybarra,Michael Gabriel",SOC,102,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Sports and Society,4,SS,,,Juniors and seniors electing an introductory course should elect SOC 300 or SOC 302.,May not be included in a Sociology major.,May be repeated for a maximum of 8 credit(s).

Throughout the course, we will also analyze collective resistance to violence, including social movements and campus activism. We will use various texts, including social and political theory, ethnography, memoir, legal documents, artwork, online activism, and film. Topics will include intimate partner violence, sexual assault and rape, forced sterilization, gaslighting, sexual harassment, and violence against LGBQ and trans people.","Sweet, Paige  ",SOC,105,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002, - Gender-Based Violence,3,SS,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",May not be included in a Sociology major.,May not be repeated for credit.

International Migration and the Politics of Membership in a Globalizing World,"From the presidential election in the U.S. to the “migration crisis” in Europe, international migration proves to be one of the most pressing issues in the contemporary world that demand our attention. The growing movement of peoples across national boundaries transforms not only the receiving but also the sending societies. It does so by altering the nature and significance of fundamental institutions and categories of membership that shape the contemporary society — as well as sociology as a discipline — such as the nation-state, citizenship, kinship, race, ethnicity, gender, and class. This course provides an introductory look into the topic of, and the major debates surrounding, international migration. Why do people migrate across international borders? Can nation-states control migration, especially “unwanted” or “unauthorized” migration? What are the policies that many migrant-receiving countries, including the United States, have developed to let some people in while keeping others out? What are the policies that many migrant-sending countries have developed to secure the loyalty and belonging of emigrants abroad? How do race, ethnicity, gender, and (il)legality shape people’s experience of international migration, and how does international migration in turn transform these fundamental legal, social, and cultural categories? How does our extant understanding of national sovereignty, economic development, political democracy, and global justice change as we consider international migration? This course takes a comparative and global perspective, encouraging students to move beyond the U.S. focused understanding of the phenomenon. The course is open to anyone with an interest in international migration and a willingness to examine the difficult academic, political, and ethical questions that international migration raises in the 21st century.","Kim,Jaeeun",SOC,204,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

The Experience of Social Class in College and the Community,"The course examines how social class inequality is created, reproduced, and experienced. We hold as ideals the importance of fairness, equal opportunity, and upward mobility as the reward for talent and hard work. To what degree are we able to live up to these ideals and in what ways does social class complicate their realization?","Sullivan,Matthew Brian",SOC,242,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Politics, Power, and Society","Political sociologists study the influence of social forces on formal and informal politics. The production, conservation and distribution of power and authority occur in Congress, but also in family dynamics, schools, welfare policies, social movements, international institutions and in the global economy. In this course, we will examine such areas using the theoretical framework and analytic tools of political sociology. We will ask questions such as: What is power, and how can we measure it empirically? What are the origins and contemporary dynamics of welfare states? How are public policies formed and what are their consequences for social inequality? What are political forces of exclusion/discrimination in democratic society? What about the politics of transnational social movements and global change? Readings from the course aim to provide both national and international answers for these questions.","de Souza Leao,Luciana",SOC,250,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Computational Social Sciences,"Due to the growth in electronic sources such as cell phones, Facebook, Twitter, and other online platforms, researchers now have enormous amounts of data about every aspect of our lives – from what we buy, to where we go, to who we know, to what we believe. This has led to a revolution in social science, as we are able to measure human behavior with precision largely thought impossible just a decade ago. Computational Social Science is an exciting and emerging field that sits at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and social science. This course provides a hands-on, non-technical introduction to the methods and ideas of Computational Social Science. We will discuss how new online data sources and the methods that are being used to analyze them can shed new light on old social science questions, and also ask brand new questions. We will also explore some of the ethical and privacy challenges of living in a world where big data and algorithmic decision-making have become more commonplace. Each week, students will have the opportunity to try their hand at analyzing big data from sources ranging from online dating profiles to New York City taxicabs to #metoo Tweets and other sources. Note that this course is a 4-credit course that includes a weekly, 2-hour lab component in addition to lecture and discussion.","Romero,Daniel M",SOC,251,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,,"One intro statistics course (for example, STATS 250 or its social science equivalent).",,May not be repeated for credit.

The first half of the course familiarizes students with the historical roots of contemporary global inequalities, starting with the legacies of colonialism, the construction of the post-World War II world order, and the rise of neoliberalism. We will also compare major theories of development, including modernization, dependency, and world-systems. The second half of the course surveys different topics in the study and practice of development as it connects to poverty and inequality in countries of the so-called Global South, with the aim to critically approach themes such as gender, cash transfers, microcredit, and public health from a sociological perspective.","de Souza Leao,Luciana",SOC,295,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Poverty and Inequality in the Global South,3,SS,,,,,May be elected three times for credit.

Introduction to Sociological Theory,"Throughout history, human beings have constructed more or less elaborate descriptions and explanations of the social world—of its origins, nature, and future trajectory. Only in recent centuries has such theorizing become a specialized vocation premised on secular, “scientific” assumptions. In this course, students will learn to read, think, speak, and write about some of the most influential sociological theories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The ultimate goal of the course is to come to view sociology as a “living science,” and sociological theory as something that should not be relegated to the ivory tower, but constitutes a necessary set of tools to make sense of the world we inhabit and the lives we lead on a daily basis. We will therefore work at applying concepts and theories to understand the contemporary world and thereby come to see ordinary life as well as larger events in new ways.","Zubrzycki,Genevieve",SOC,305,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,,,At least one course in introductory sociology.,It is highly recommended that sociology majors not elect both SOC 305 and SOC 310 in the same term.,May not be repeated for credit.
Sociological Research Methods,"This course introduces students to the main ways that sociologists conduct research. Key themes include the different approaches that researchers use to collect and analyze data about society: asking people questions (interviews and surveys), observing and participating in social life (ethnography and experiments), and examining records and documents (contemporary and historical). We will consider the strengths and weaknesses of these methods in order to see how each approach is appropriate for some questions and less useful for others. Throughout the term, students will also gain firsthand experience with social research by conducting their own research project on a topic of their choice and producing a small-scale research paper.","Stuart Brundage, Jonah  ",SOC,310,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"ULWR, BS, QR/1",,,Sociology majors are strongly encouraged to elect SOC 310 in their junior year.

The Politics of Data,"This course will concentrate on the importance of the Federal Statistical System for the governance of our country. The data from the Federal Statistical System is essential for our democracy as these data are the fuel for policy decisions by the federal government and state/local policymakers as well. The alternative is policy-by-anecdote. Unfortunately, there is an increased politicization of data – what should be collected, how a concept should be measured, who should be included in the data and who gets to see it. And even more critical is the outright refusal to fund, use or believe the evidence that comes from federal statistics.","Neidert,Lisa J",SOC,331,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Sociology of the Body,"Many of us experience “our” body in individualistic fashion and think of “the body” as purely biological. But bodies and embodiment are profoundly social and deeply symbolic. They are sites of power, pleasure, pain, and -- for some – privilege. Bodies are vessels of identity and vehicles of social interaction and exclusion from it. Whether bone structure, size, adornment or demeanor, the social world literally shapes our bodies and our experiences of/in them. This course explores bodies and embodiment in relation to culture, history and social relations. Topics include intersex, racialized bodies, gendered bodies, sporting bodies, and “(dis)abled” bodies.","McGann, PJ  ",SOC,346,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,One introductory course in Sociology or Women's Studies.,,May not be repeated for credit.

Topics in Sociology,"Cognitive sociology asks fundamental questions about the relationship between society, mind, and behavior. How does public culture enter the mind to become individual cognition? How does it intertwine with cognitive universals to structure individual tastes, thoughts, actions, and experiences?

Topics in Sociology,"This seminar explores the intersections between race, sexuality, and violence in the making of Western modernity. Historical in scope, students will develop a broad theoretical understanding of how race, sexuality, and violence shape and construct one another and operate as systems of power. We will draw on other disciplines—from art history to literary analysis—in order to explore the ways in which race, sexuality, and violence have operated to create social hierarchies, construct normative categories, maintain relations of power, and shape individual identities at different historical moments. We will also consider the challenges of doing historical research on these topics, with particular attention to the silences that available sources do not address, and possibilities for overcoming them. ","Mahan,Margo Myra",SOC,495,"Winter 2022, ",Section 004, - Race & Sexuality,3,,,,One introductory course in Sociology.,,May be elected three times for credit.

"Survey of Latin American Literature, I","This course is an introduction to colonial Latin American studies. It is organized around a series of important questions or problems that emerged with the so-called “discovery” (i.e. the conquest and colonization) of the so-called “New World” (i.e. the Americas). Central to the ideology of the Spanish empire, these overlapping questions involve the legitimacy of the conquest; the production of knowledge about the Americas and its inhabitants; and the exploitation of American people and resources. Although participants in these discussions drew on older discursive traditions and authoritative sources, they had to deploy them in ways that diverged fundamentally from prior usage. As a result, many scholars believe that the answers proposed to these questions established some of the paradigms that continue to structure the modern world. The course is organized thematically, and we will follow each problem and its implications chronologically over the course of the colonial period by reading texts produced in and about the Americas between the late fifteenth and the eighteenth centuries.","Nemser,Daniel J",SPANISH,381,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Spanish Colonialism and the Ideology of Empire,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Social Forces and Cultural Production in Medieval/Early Modern Spain,"In the year 1492, we all know that ""Columbus sailed the ocean blue""—but that is not all that happened! It was also a year of critical shifts that affected the history of the Mediterranean Sea. 1492 was the year that the Christian armies conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in the Iberian Peninsula. It was the year the first grammar of the Spanish language was published. It was also the year that the Catholic Monarchs, Fernando, and Isabel, expelled all of the Jews from the Peninsula, forcing them to resettle across the Mediterranean. When Columbus arrived in the Americas, the medieval world was already undergoing radical changes that would transform it forever, giving way to Early Modern Spanish culture and the beginnings of the Spanish empire and the Spanish language. This course will explore the meaning of 1492 for Spanish literature, art, film, and culture, including the foundation of Spanish grammar and the foundations of Spain as a global power. It will look at the legend of Boabdil, the last Muslim ruler who surrendered the Alhambra in Granada. It will read early writing about the voyage of Columbus to the Americas. And it will explore the importance of 1492 for Jewish culture, as the Jews relocated to other Mediterranean and Atlantic lands but preserved many aspects of Spanish culture and language. This course will explore how in 1492, entire worlds were made and unmade, and Spain itself was born as a power that would rule from the Mediterranean to the Pacific.","Szpiech, Ryan  ",SPANISH,387,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - 1492 and the Mediterranean,3,HU,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Obras como La Celestina y El Lazarillo evidencian un marcado malestar social que tiene que ver con una sociedad desigual que se aferra a estamentos tradicionales y obsoletos.

We will reflect on how different sociopolitical contexts contribute to the construction of femininity and masculinity in society and regulate sexuality. We will analyze the construction of the female character in movies such as, on the one hand, an “object of desire” and, on the other hand, a “monstrous feminine” (Barbara Creed). We will examine the social construction of masculinity between hegemonic and contra-hegemonic models and stereotypes considering famous movies such as “Plata Quemada” and “Fresa y Chocolate.” Finally, we will close the course with a section dedicated to the queer gaze and movies by Pedro Almodóvar, Anna Muylaert, and Sebastián Lelio.

Political and Economic Thought in Latin America/Spain,"Capitalism is not a natural order that has existed from the beginning of time. It has a history, and we can study that history to see when and how it emerged. While Britain’s Industrial Revolution is probably the most familiar reference point, some of the most important economic thinkers, including Adam Smith and Karl Marx, point to the so-called “discovery” (i.e. the conquest and colonization) of the Americas as a key moment in this process. Taking these arguments as its point of departure, this course explores the colonial roots of modern capitalism by examining the writings of Spanish and Portuguese jurists, theologians, and missionaries about the colonial project and its economic implications from the late fifteenth to the mid seventeenth centuries. What new problems and dilemmas did Iberian colonialism raise, and how did early modern writers attempt to rationalize and resolve them? What new political and economic ideas emerged as a result? To what extent did these writers seek to reconcile political domination and economic extraction with their stated spiritual and religious objectives? More broadly, how should we understand the relation between colonialism and capitalism, and what does that analysis mean for our understanding of the world today? Readings will consist for the most part of primary sources from the colonial period, but will also include more recent work by political economists, critics, and historians.","Nemser,Daniel J",SPANISH,438,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Conquest and Capitalism,3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Political and Economic Thought in Latin America/Spain,"This course will study the symbiosis of politics, economy, and ideology in the making of modern Latin America. Taught in Spanish, the course will be divided into three parts: Part 1 will discuss how liberalism connected with the organization of modern Latin America. Part 2 will have students exposed to two ideological discourses which followed after the decline of liberalism: populism, and neoliberalism. Part 3 will discuss three important discourses which counteracted capitalism: dependency theory, socialism, and the theology of liberation.","Sanjines,Javier C",SPANISH,438,"Winter 2022, ",Section 002," - Economy, Politics, and Ideology in Latin America",3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Literatures and Cultures of the Borderlands: The Politics of Language,"This course is an exploration of Latinx literature and culture in the United States, with a special focus on the Chicanx or Mexican-American, Nuyorican/Puerto Rican, Dominican-American, Cuban-American, and Central American-American experience. What role does language play in Latinx culture? How is language a part of different communities and cultural productions? How do Latinx artists and writers use language in their work? In this class, we will examine film, literature, music, performance, and video, and see the use of Spanish, English, Spanglish, Pachuco Caló, and other language varieties, and how language proficiency affects the social experience. Practices such as code-switching will receive particular attention. The analysis will focus on the role of age, class, ethnicity, family, gender, generational differences, geographical location, historical period, immigrant status, place of birth, race, and sexual orientation as these relate to linguistic usage in the works studied, and on the specific effects and uses of language in cultural productions. Consideration will be given to the ways in which each particular cultural medium produces meaning.","La Fountain-Stokes,Lawrence M",SPANISH,440,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,Conducted in Spanish.,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Romance Studies: Introduction to French-Spanish Literary Relations,"This course seeks to familiarize students with the complex and multifaceted tradition of Marxist theory and practice while also tracing Marxism’s role in some of today’s most vibrant political movements. Our comparative approach will consider classical texts like The Communist Manifesto and State and Revolution alongside lesser-known but no less important works by Latin American and Caribbean writers and intellectuals. Instead of working toward a single definition of Marxism, we will explore the history of heterodox experimentation with the tradition’s most basic categories, always mindful of the continuities and discontinuities between different “Marxisms.” This necessarily interdisciplinary course will incorporate readings and discussions that span philosophy, literature, history, and politics. Special focus will be directed at Marxist analyses that attend to (and also sometimes fail to attend to) the interpenetration of class, race, and gender. Key figures for the course include: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, V. I. Lenin, Clara Zetkin, Mao Tse-Tung, Louis Althusser, Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, José Carlos Mariátegui, José María Arguedas, Álvaro García Linera, Raquel Guttiérez, Subcomandante Marcos, and Silvia Federici.","Arnall,Gavin",SPANISH,445,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Comparative Marxism,3,,,,A reading knowledge of French and Spanish.,,May not be repeated for credit.
The Archive,"The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) became an international cause that drew volunteer combatants from around the world and energized the anti-fascist movement. While Hitler and Mussolini backed the military uprising with arms and troops, the democratic Allies adopted the policy of ""appeasement""—remaining neutral and refusing to support or sell arms to the Spanish Republic. In response, activists in those neutral countries mobilized to urge their governments to aid the Republic. They wanted to make Spain the “tomb of fascism”—by halting the spread of fascism and the military build-up to world war.","Highfill,Juli A",SPANISH,447,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - The Spanish Civil War and Student Activism at the University of Michigan,3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Case Studies in Peninsular Spanish and Latin American Literature,"As we read the drama and poetry of Federico García Lorca, we will consider these works as reflections on ""lived history."" We will examine Lorca's childhood in Granada; his years in the ""Residencia de Estudiantes"" with Dalí and Buñuel; his interest in gypsy and Andalusian culture; his involvement in surrealism; his year in New York (1929-30) where he explored jazz-age Harlem, experienced a vibrant gay culture, and witnessed the stock market crash; his work for the Spanish Republic as director of the traveling theater troupe ""La Barraca""; and his death in the first weeks of the Spanish Civil War. While we consider Lorca's works against this historical background, we will also learn about the ""Asociación para la Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica"" and its efforts to preserve the memory of the Spanish Civil War. This organization has pressed for the exhumations of the ""fosas comunes"" (the common graves of victims of executions)—among them, the site where Lorca's remains were believed to lie near Granada. In reading Lorca’s work, we will begin with an overview of his poetry and then turn to his plays, among them: “El público,” “Bodas de sangre,” and “Yerma.” Other readings include: selections from a biography, articles, and selected letters from Lorca's correspondence. Assignments include: two exams, two papers, a translation, a group production of a scene from a play, and an oral presentation (also in groups).

Case Studies in Peninsular Spanish and Latin American Literature,"In this course, we will critically explore the history of US-Mexico relations. Starting in the early 19th century and moving into the present, we will engage different forms of written and visual culture- including travel journals, legislature, journalistic pieces, novels, maps, and film- to explore how cultural interventions have mediated, shaped, and represented the uneven political and economic interactions between both countries. The course will pay particular attention to how the question of race has played out in this complicated history. While at moments, both countries’ governments have joined efforts and collaborated in shaping racialized geographies that stretch across their borders, at others, frictions and tensions have marked the tone of the interactions between them. This course will trace both the changing and persistent tropes circling around US-Mexico political and economic relations, opening a space to critically reflect on the present. Some of the topics we will discuss in class include the history and formation of the border; economic interests and projects like NAFTA; the so-called war on drugs.","Sabau Fernandez,Ana",SPANISH,485,"Winter 2022, ",Section 003, - Imperial Borders: Mexico and the US,3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Topics in Hispanic Literature/History/Culture,"This course offers an introduction to some of the recent thinking and forms of representation in the Spanish and English-speaking worlds that seek to reconsider the relationship between the human and its limits/limitations. Under question are human exceptionalism and the historical dualisms that constitute it (nature/culture, human/non-human, mind/body, self/other, subject/object, whiteness/social death, etc). The course combines interdisciplinary conceptual perspectives with a focus on how the relationship between humans, non-humans, and the object world has been represented, questioned, and problematized in recent cultural production. The course ultimately seeks to think critically about what it means to be human today if, that is, such a thing has ever been possible.","Williams,Gareth",SPANISH,488,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credit(s).

Mathematics of Data,"This course is open to graduate students and upper-level undergraduates in applied mathematics, bioinformatics, statistics, and engineering, who are interested in learning from data. Students with other backgrounds such as life sciences are also welcome, provided they have maturity in mathematics. The mathematical content in this course will be linear algebra, multilinear algebra, dynamical systems, and information theory. This content is required to understand some common algorithms in data science. I will start with a very basic introduction to data representation as vectors, matrices, and tensors. Then I will teach geometric methods for dimension reduction, also known as manifold learning (e.g. diffusion maps, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), etc.), and topological data reduction (introduction to computational homology groups, etc.). I will bring an application-based approach to spectral graph theory, addressing the combinatorial meaning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their associated graph matrices and extensions to hypergraphs via tensors. I will also provide an introduction to the application of dynamical systems theory to data including dynamic mode decomposition. Real data examples will be given where possible and I will work with you write code implementing these algorithms to solve these problems. The methods discussed in this class are shown primarily for biological data, but are useful in handling data across many fields. A course features several guest lectures from industry and government.

History of Medicine in the Western World from the 18th Century to the Present,"""The history of medicine is, in fact, the history of humanity itself, with its ups and downs, its brave aspirations after truth and finality, its pathetic failures. The subject may be treated variously as a pageant, an array of books, a procession of characters, a succession of theories, and exposition of human ineptitude, or the very bone and marrow of cultural history."" —Fielding Garrison, An Introduction to the History of Medicine  In History 234 we shall adopt each of these approaches and more. Birth, life, illness, and death are universal experiences for all of humankind. How do we think about these experiences? Who do we call to attend childbirth? Who do we call to care for the sick and the dying? The answers to these questions have been quite different for different people at different times and in different places. We will consider the perspectives of not only elite healers, but also of typical patients. We will examine the history of ideas and institutions, asking: Who has practiced medicine? How did those practitioners claim legitimacy? How have changes in medical thinking changed the practice of medicine? Sources will include primary and secondary sources readings, artwork, film, literature, and theater. There is no textbook; with the exception of two plays, all readings will be available on Canvas. The course will use specification grading, which is based on quizzes and blog posts.","Howell,Joel D",STS,234,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,ID,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Minds and Brains in America,"What is the mind? And how does it relate to the brain? These are old, even ancient questions, but it is only in the last two centuries that specific scientific fields have arisen to answer them. This course explores the history of those fields (psychology, psychiatry, and cognitive science) and their impact on American politics, popular culture, and private life. The science and medicine of mind and brain have deeply shaped who we are, what we do, and how we treat others (including people, animals, and machines). This course examines key moments in this history: from the rise of the asylum and phrenology around 1800, through the growth of eugenics and psychoanalysis a century later, to the advent of MRI and artificial intelligence in recent years. By tracing the tools used to study, police, and alter the minds and brains of ordinary Americans, we will work toward a new history of scientific authority in the United States.","Cowles,Henry",STS,265,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Science, Technology, Medicine, and Society","From iPhones to intelligence testing to immunizations, technology, science, and medicine permeate our modern lives. In this course, students will learn to think critically about technology, science, and medicine and analyze how they have transformed the world in spectacular and mundane ways. We explore questions such as: How has the development of the medical profession shaped debates about inoculation or the AIDS epidemic? How have culture and politics affected the goals and designs of such technologies as guns, washing machines, and electrical systems? How have science, technology, and politics interacted in debates over climate change? And, ultimately, how should we manage the tension between popular democracy and technical expertise?","Carson, John  ",STS,285,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Medical Anthropology,"Medical Anthropology examines illness and healing in cross-cultural perspective. How do people make meaning of their suffering? What determines what is normal and what pathological? How are morality and medicine intertwined? We will examine the ways in which individuals experience illness and seek (and provide) care in the context of local understandings of the body and self; consider the roles of social, political, and economic processes in the shaping of suffering and care; examine a variety of healing systems —including biomedicine—as social institutions that both reflect and influence what people “know” to be true.","Peters-Golden,Holly",STS,344,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

We will learn how to transcribe or notate and analyze selected non-western and world musics from sub-Saharan Africa, North African and Asia. Some of the analytical tools we will employ include, Western music notation (in some instances), textual analysis, cultural analysis, number notation, the sonic visualizer, polyrhythmic block (PRB) analysis, degree of pitch repetition (DPR), and the Time Unit Box (TUB), all of which have been used by various music scholars but only to the attention of a few.

Broadway and American Culture,"Do you think musical theatre has room for #Hamilfan and #BroadwaySoWhite? Do you feel the emotional power of Golden Age musicals like South Pacific and wriggle with discomfort at the stereotypical depictions of minority characters? Do you wonder why musicals by/for People of Color are so infrequently on Broadway? Are you curious about whether a feel-good, glittery, jazz hands wielding, pop-rock belting, “unserious” art form has something to say about serious issues in America? Can you stand listening to showtunes, a lot of showtunes? If the answers are yes, this class is for you. This course will explore the history of racial representation in musical theatre, how popular theatrical performance constructs race as an identifiable category, and techniques of analysis for “reading” performances to understand the cultural construction happening within and through American musical theatre. We will build a critical vocabulary and a set of analytical tools for critiquing representation in embodied performance and attending to the relationship between musical theatre and American culture. We will also pay attention to the material impact of artistic and production choices (i.e. casting, revisals, royalties) on the politics and practices of categorization, identity, and representation. Attendance of live theatre is required but given the diversity of student experiences and commitments will be approached flexibly.

Theater of Politics,"ENGLISH 311/THTREMUS 328 will support a humanities-based study in theater and politics beginning with a historic perspective and proceeding through current times.
 In Washington DC, the theater scene has discovered a wealth of material. Not surprisingly, some of it — though hardly all — is political in nature. What does it mean to present “political theater” in a political The Washington theater scene and discovered a wealth of material on DC stages; some of it — though hardly all, surprisingly (or not) — political in nature. What is “political theater” historically, what does it mean in a political town, and what does it mean more practically today? The narratives being told reflect how we view the past, the present, and how we envision the future. We’ll have a chance to think about the role of theater in society in this unique city. We consider why Washingtonians have gone to theater traditionally, why they are attending now, what stories they want to see, and how theaters program for the current body of theater-goers. As theaters try to engage new audiences, they are defining themselves and their current mission. Looking at theater in previous decades, what are theaters showing us about the times we’ve lived in and the perspectives they bring now? We explore the theater’s various functions, for example in times of affluence and ascendancy. In times of anxiety and descent, in may serve to prick the conscience and allow for escape. Clearly, we need a theater that lifts us up. This semester, we’ll see Washington’s answer by learning what theaters are announcing for their upcoming seasons, how they’ve arrived at those decisions, and what those decisions mean. At its heart, this is a Theater Appreciation course, with an emphasis on viewing plays in performance, responding to them in post-show discussions, in journal entries, on student-led public panels, and in creative presentations shared with the class and sometimes even an audience. The line-up of plays in production offers a useful survey of contemporary American voices as well as the historical continuity starting with adapted Greek tragedy. By the end of the course, all the theater companies we’ve visited will have announced new seasons, allowing us to examine those choices as we announce our own proposed seasons as well.Course Requirements:Weekly journaling, student-led public panels, creative in-class presentations, attending performances, and responding to performances both in-class and in public post-show discussions. See syllabus for details.Intended Audience:All students accepted to the Michigan in Washington programClass Format:1.5 hours/twice weekly","

Theatre and Incarceration,"Artistic practice in prisons has occurred since the inception of prisons themselves, though popular thought tends not to connect the idea of the arts with that of criminal justice systems. This course surveys the history of performance in prisons through the examination of plays written by and about prisoners as well as narratives which chronicle the process of creating theatre in prisons. The course also interrogates various strategies for creating performances in prisons, questioning the utility and goals of each process of creation and seeking to identify those which are most sustainable and which best serve participants in the process.  Students will use some of these strategies in practice as they facilitate their workshops in prisons and juvenile detention centers.","Lucas,Ashley Elizabeth",THTREMUS,335,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,With permission of instructor.,,,May not be repeated for credit.

Introduction to Information Studies,"Are we in the midst of an Information Revolution? Is the Information Age essentially different from other periods in history and if so, how? What role does Information, and the myriad systems for processing and disseminating Information, play in individual lives, or in society as a whole? How can we build effective Information Systems to accomplish important goals such as facilitating commerce, fostering civic participation, and supporting human relationships? This course will provide the foundational knowledge necessary to begin to address the key issues associated with Information and its impact on human lives. Issues will range from the theoretical (what is Information, and how do humans construct it?), to the cultural (is life on the screen a qualitatively different phenomenon from experiences with earlier distance-shrinking and knowledge-building technologies such as telephones?), to the practical (what are the basic architectures of computing and networks?). Successful completion of this ""gateway"" course will give you the conceptual tools necessary to understand the politics, economics, and culture of the Information Age, providing a foundation for later study in Information or a valuable complement to studies in other disciplines.","Wallace,David A",UC,110,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
First-Year Social Science Seminar,"This course will incorporate several  types of   media –print, video,  and  audio-- to engage students in  discussions  of a  variety of  social and political issues which relate to healthcare.

First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar,"This seminar is designed to explore three facets of the argument for vegetarianism: sustainability, health, and animal welfare. We’ll read, debate, and do original research on questions such as: 
Is avoiding meat better for the environment? How much better? Is there any amount of meat consumption that might be truly sustainable? How do researchers measure the environmental effects of what we eat in the first place? 

When it comes to human health, what kinds of effects does following a vegetarian diet have? Are there any potential negative trade-offs? Can everyone, including athletes and people prone to anemia, thrive on a vegetarian diet? 

As for animal welfare, what are conditions in the meat industry like? Are small farms better than big ones? Is hunting wild game more or less ethical than raising animals for food? Do fish and bivalves deserve the same moral consideration as pigs and cows? How would a transition to eating less meat and more plants affect rodents, birds, and downstream aquatic life?","Finn, Margot  ",UC,154,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Should we eat meat?,3,ID,FYSem,,"Enrollment restricted to first-year students, including those with sophomore standing.",,May not be repeated for credit.

Social Science Seminars on Women and Gender,"Have you ever encountered a feminist activist from a foreign country? Why have some women decided to take action to make a difference in their societies? Feminist activism has long been a global phenomenon but our knowledge of feminists in diverse regions is very limited.

No prior knowledge of the history of these countries is required, although the course will introduce these activists against their specific historical and cultural settings. The purpose of the course is to expand students’ intellectual horizon with a global perspective and to prepare students for academic life in college by introducing some analytical skills, such as historical analysis and close reading of texts in both written and visual forms. The course will also highlight oral history as a research method for producing new knowledge.

Special Topics in Interdisciplinary Women's and Gender Studies,"Who ‘belongs’ in college, and who feels like they belong?  In this course, we examine the ways U.S. colleges and universities -- through their curricula, architecture, cultures, policies, and programs -- have included and excluded various groups of students along lines of gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, and other systems of power and difference. Our readings and discussions will focus in particular on the ways a broad range of women students -- including women of color, low-income women, trans women -- have navigated higher education and worked to create more inclusive and equitable institutions. Ultimately, this course prepares students to critically reflect upon their own place in the world of higher education, navigate the persistent inequities of college life with self-awareness and intention, and participate in informed ways in cultivating educational environments that foster a sense of belonging for an ever-broader range of people. Course materials include some classic feminist analyses of higher ed (e.g., bell hooks, Adrienne Rich) as well as selections from recent memoirs (Michelle Obama, Chanel Miller, Tara Westover), histories (Yale Needs Women, Women's Higher Education in the United States), and sociological studies (Paying for the Party, Trans* in College, Sexual Citizens) -- an interdisciplinary mix to help us build a complex understanding of the ways educational institutions both facilitate and constrain students’ agency, well-being, and sense of belonging. ","Braunschneider,Theresa",WGS,258,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Belonging in College: Gender, Race, Class, and Higher Education",3,ID,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

We will study debates among feminists over these legal strategies, the interaction of law with society and culture, and the ways that the intersection of gender, racial, and ethnic identities make a difference in the application and effects of the law.","Peterson,Emily Anne",WGS,270,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Introduction to the Psychology of Women and Gender,"This course will provide a broad, introductory survey of psychological science on women and gender, addressing such topics as gender stereotypes, gender socialization, love relationships, pregnancy and parenthood, gender and psychological disorders, and gendered violence. Throughout, we will learn how all of these things relate to mental health and wellbeing.","Cortina,Lilia M",WGS,291,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,"SS, RE",,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
"Gender and Immigration:  Identity, Race, and Place"," Refugees, migrants, immigrants, diaspora groups, and transnational actors are all terms that describe people who undertake different acts of mobility or travel across borders to seek refuge. But how are these terms different? This course focuses on these various acts of mobility to show how they are labeled differently under different political and social circumstances. We examine the gendered cultural and political meanings people and governments give to mobility, border-crossing, and displacement in this turbulent time in the era of globalization and transnationalism.

 

In this course we will also emphasize the experiences of both old and new generations of immigrants in order to understand the historical context of migration, globalization, and the processes involved in the imagination of place and nation building. One important lesson that students learn in this class is that the political processes that define the often-conflated meanings attached to the refugee, immigrant, and diaspora population cannot be divorced from histories of nationalism and transnationalism and their deeply rooted constructions in gender, race, ethnic, and class relations. Race, ethnicity, and sexism are significant components, and the course addresses them through cross-cultural ethnographies, media reports, documentary films, art, and other texts to explain how citizens and non-citizens are marked differently based on both legal and cultural terminologies.

 

Students also learn that systems of racialization and discrimination don’t just happen at the moment of border-crossing or when refugees, migrants, and diaspora populations settle in new homelands; these modes of exclusion are also experienced in various forms in their countries of origin. Some of the forces that lead to situations of refugee-ness, migration, and dispersal include religious, ethnic, gender, racial, and political discrimination encountered at home.  The course examines the different forms of these discriminations and how refugee, immigrant, and diaspora communities encounter them, live them, negotiate them, and resist them through their own cultural practices and other strategies of activism.

 

We will particularly explore how questions of power, race, and class intersect to shape refugees and immigrants’ daily struggles for justice and human rights. How do refugees and immigrants attempt to create and “imagine” their own social world with reference to their new locations and their homelands? Our readings and discussion will focus on cultural and theoretical perspectives from the social sciences, specifically anthropology, history, and literature.  And we will take as examples the ethnographies and narratives of immigrants from different parts of the world, specifically Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome.","Fadlalla,Amal Hassan",WGS,304,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001," - Refugees of Unjust Worlds: Globalization, Gender and Nation",3,SS,,,The seminar is intended for junior and senior undergraduates but sophomores are also welcome.,,May not be repeated for credit.
Special Topics in Gender and the Humanities,"Using a transnational, interdisciplinary, and intersectional feminist lens, this course will examine literary articulations of the complex relationship between gender and health. Defining health to include physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, sexual and/or reproductive well-being, we will read key literary works across genres - novels, short stories, essays, poetry, memoir – alongside scholarly articles to shed light on the gendered terrain of health in diverse contexts. We will also attempt to relate the textual material to society, polity, and lived experience. Course themes include, among others, the impact of gender role expectations on emotional and mental health; economic inequalities; immigrant well-being; racial, sexual, and transgender violence; eating disorders, nutrition; and holistic approaches to health. Writers include Margaret Atwood (The Edible Woman), Alice Walker (The Color Purple), Carmen Maria Manchado (Her Body and Other Parties), Casey Plett (A Safe Girl to Love), Michelle Obama (Becoming), Emily Nunn (The Comfort Food Diaries), Thich Nhat Hanh (How to Walk), Jhumpa Lahiri (Unaccustomed Earth), Gloria Anzaldua (Borderlands), Edna O’Brien (Saints and Sinners), Teju Cole (Strange and Known Things), Elizabeth Strout (Olive ), Sonia Sotomayer (My Beloved World), Rebecca Solnit (Men Explain Things to Me), and others.","Dhar,Debotri",WGS,313,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Women and Well-Being in Literature,3,HU,,,,,May be elected twice for credit.

Black Feminist Thought and Practice,"What is Black Feminism? In this course, we will explore the history of Black women’s gendered and racial politics in the United States and, in particular, how their beliefs and experiences have differed from other groups. How have Black women pushed back against and attempted to reshape traditional, Eurocentric, “white feminist” politics? How have Black Feminist responses to racism diverged from and challenged mainstream and Black masculinist political scripts? We will explore these questions as well as representations of Black women’s sexuality and political activism. Course readings are drawn from a variety of disciplines and time periods with the goal of exposing students to the history of Black Feminist thought and the breadth of Black Feminist scholarship, activism, and methodologies. By the end of the semester, students will be conversant in the major concepts of Black Feminism and Black Women’s Studies and have developed the analytical tools to understand how race, gender, and class interact to produce the unique experiences of Black women in the United States.","Strongman,Saraellen",WGS,323,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Childbirth & Culture,"This course focuses on the distinctive sociocultural configurations of childbirth practices and beliefs over time and in different societies. Exploring the great variety in how childbirth is managed and made meaningful across the world and in the United States reveals the cultural logics underlying practices and beliefs surrounding childbirth. We will analyze birth as a biosocial, biocultural process that reveals much about our understandings of gender, the body, medical authority, spiritual authority, community, and individual agency during pregnancy and childbirth. Throughout our study, we will pay careful attention to the experiences of the birthing parent throughout the medicalization of childbirth and its move to biomedical settings that prioritize the child and hospital protocols. Selected readings, films, advertisements, and other media will serve as material for our analysis. The goals of this course are twofold: To investigate how childbirth informs and reflects cultural beliefs, and to empower students, as future health professionals, birth support personnel, and/or birthing parents, to make informed and compassionate choices during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and the postpartum period.","Stuckey, Leigh  ",WGS,324,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,SS,,,Sophomore standing.,,May not be repeated for credit.
The History of Sexuality,"Does sex have a history? This course proposes to respond to this provocative question by demonstrating how modern notions of sexuality have emerged historically. In that sense, sex is not part of nature, it is part of culture, or rather cultures and their histories.","Babayan,Kathryn",WGS,327,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Feminist Thought,"This course explores major intellectual debates and dialogues in the field of feminist thought. How has feminist theory – as an expansive body of scholarship that situates marginalized voices at the core of analysis – evolved as a response to “androcentric” ways of knowing? Is there a “feminist method”? Interrogating the gendered trajectories of knowledge production, and how women have figured as silenced subjects of texts, genres, and paternalistic state policies, we will examine the contributions of multiple feminisms – liberal, materialist, poststructuralist, postcolonial, woman-of-color feminisms, and feminisms of faith, for instance, and their interstices – and how they unsettle gendered binaries and essentialist understandings. Using a transnational lens to trace the ways in which gender intersects with race, social class, nation, ethnicity, sexuality, disability and other registers of identity to produce complex structures of power and privilege in different locations and under differing historical conditions, we will examine their relevance to individual and collective experience. Eschewing an uneasy relationship between feminism in theory and practice, we will probe, instead, how the nuances of feminist thought might be applied to research, literature, art, education, and policy. The course is interdisciplinary. It will deploy literary, historical, political, philosophical, sociological, and economic perspectives, and weave together a variety of theoretical, analytical, and creative texts.","Dhar,Debotri",WGS,330,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Feminist Theoretical Perspectives in Gender and Health,"This interdisciplinary course focuses on feminist theory, specifically in the context of race, gender, and health. This course is organized by health topic with articles and literature selected to be useful for discussions of theory. Focusing heavily, although not exclusively on the experiences of African American women, topics include mental health, feminist disability, reproductive studies, bio-politics and fat studies, among others. We will cover a range of theories central to feminism including intersectionality, feminist standpoint theory, minority stress, and constructions of health and disease.","Louis,Diana Martha",WGS,331,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Special Topics in LGBTQ Studies,"In 2014, Time Magazine announced “The Transgender Tipping Point” as the “next civil rights frontier.” Even as transgender celebrities including Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox have drawn national audiences, bathrooms have become battlegrounds for gender justice, and trans people have been targeted by hate crimes and state violence. While trans rights may appear to be a relatively new phenomenon, even a “frontier,” transgender and gender non-conforming people and communities have a long history in American Culture. This course seeks to explore contemporary transgender movements, politics, and identities in historical context. Throughout the course, we will be particularly attentive to the ways that race, class, citizenship, and ability are connected to gender variance, and we will highlight the scholarship and activism of trans people of color.","Larson,Scott",WGS,341,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Transgender American Histories,3,,,,WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240) or WGS 245 (WOMENSTD 245).,,May be elected twice for credit.

Special Topics in Gender and Health,"This course will explore the social and medical implications of doula work. A doula is a person who provides advice, education, emotional, psychological, and physical support to people undergoing transformative or difficult life events. In western culture, these life events are usually handled as medical events, for example childbirth, miscarriage, or death. Humans have probably always relied on witnessing, touch, and attention to emotional states as part of healing practices, but science is finally able to quantify and explain some of the therapeutic effects of these practices. In addition, new research is connecting doula work with reduced healthcare spending, so this course will also explore the ways that doulas challenge or support the overall biomedical system. Students will look at the history of doula work and survey the ways that doulas offer support across the life spectrum, including birth and postpartum doulas, end-of-life doulas, healthcare ambassadors, and pregnancy loss doulas. Students will be expected to offer doula support in real world settings (such as offering postpartum support to new parents or compile resources for people facing health challenges) and analyze and explore their own practical world experiences in light of current research.","Gabriel,Cynthia A",WGS,342,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Helping Hands: The Science of Doulas,3,,,,WGS/NURS 220 (WOMENSTD/NURS 220) or WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240).,,May be elected twice for credit.

Special Topics in Gender in a Global Context,"This course examines, through a comparative, transnational, and intersectional feminist lens, the complex relationship(s) between sexual violence and the state under differing historical contexts and in diverse geographical locations. We will interrogate the colonial and the postcolonial, “first” and “third” worlds, text and context. Tracing how gender intersects with race, religion, nation, social class, and sexuality, we will frame sexual violence as simultaneously personal and political as we critically examine the political, cultural, legal, regulatory and discursive roles of the state. Some of the material focuses on South Asia; however, the scope of the course is historically and geographically broad. The course is interdisciplinary; we will draw from historical, literary, visual, political, sociological and other perspectives and the productive interstices between them. We will weave together theoretical, analytical, and creative (e.g. fiction, film, art) texts. There will also be in-class case studies that we will collectively examine.","Dhar,Debotri",WGS,345,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Sexual Violence and the State,3,,,,WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240).,,May be elected twice for credit.

Leading Feminism,"Leading Feminism will explore the relationships between gender, power, influence, and leadership in the United States context. What is leadership? How do we understand power and influence? How are our understandings gendered? What is the impact on leadership opportunities across the gender spectrum? What is the impact on organizations and communities? How do leaders and aspiring leaders effectively employ feminist values and strategies and navigate, communicate, manage, and lead to maximize personal contributions and support organizational goals? If you aspire to lead, what kind of leader do you want to be? What result do you desire to create in the world? Leading Feminism is an action-learning, focused exploration of feminist practice and leadership. Students commit to classroom engagement and community involvement. Students engage in service-mentorship partnerships with leaders across a variety of sectors (nonprofit, public, private, or corporate). Students are expected to dedicate approximately 50 hours over the course of the semester to the completion of an action-learning project that contributes to their mentors' organization. The course draws upon feminist and management texts, publications from authoritative organizations, as well as current media. Students will think critically about gender and leadership, the many sectors in which feminist practice is applicable and needed, and examine how course concepts apply to their site organizations as well as their own career aspirations. Th. Interested students may start early to think about possible mentors and identify one within their current networks.","Welch,Leseliey Rose",WGS,351,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,,"CBL, Experiential",,"One course in Women's & Gender Studies.

A History of Witchcraft: The 1692 Salem Trials in Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspective,"The Salem Witch Trials, America's most famous witchcraft episode, drew on a long history of witchcraft belief, accusation, and prosecution in Europe and the New World. This course explores the long context of European witchcraft belief from medieval theology to through The Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, and American Horror Story.   Witchcraft raises questions about human society and belief, about fear and responses to fear. Ideas about gendered bodies played out in deadly ways during the time era of witch-burnings. Modern responses to witchcraft range from historical and psychological analysis, to satanic and neo-pagan feminist revivals, to fantasy novels and movies. We will study them all. The topic is fun, and also deeply serious. In our current moment, when politicians claim to be victims of witch hunts, women's bodies are subjects of national debate, and torture is again endorsed, the historical witch-craze offers unsettling parallels.","Kivelson,Valerie Ann",WGS,375,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,4,HU,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.
Topics in Gender and Social Science,"This course examines transnational feminism(s) as both an interdisciplinary field and a mode of movement-building. The course begins with exploring the historical roots of transnational feminism in global, women of color, and Third World or postcolonial feminisms. Students will learn about the feminist interventions of the mid-90s into women’s and gender studies to destabilize the debates and practices of universalism, representation, and knowledge production. The second part of the course examines how feminist scholars and activists around the world, particularly from the Global South, shape our understanding of contemporary issues in transnational feminisms, both within and beyond borders. We will cover topics such as reproduction, family, and the state; nationalism, war, and militarism; colonialism, development, and capitalism; and migration and humanitarianism. The course will pay particular attention to the ongoing (and often unequal) exchanges between feminist, queer, anti-racist, anti-imperialist, and other social justice struggles in different parts of the world. Students will emerge from this course with a strong foundation in transnational feminisms as an interdisciplinary field and an understanding of how different feminist mobilizations across the globe are intimately interconnected.","

Many things that 21st century readers take for granted—that people tend to be straight or gay and that romance makes sex most fulfilling—did not concern them.

In this Upper Level Writing requirement course, we will examine key genealogies, debates, histories and questions emerging from the intersections of blackness, gender, sexuality and class in the U.S. This course will cross both disciplinary and methodological boundaries as we examine histories of Black queer and queer of color social movements; literature that reflects Black LGBTQ experiences; Black queer performances; and the numerous interventions that Black queer theories have made into questions of citizenship, race, gender, sexuality, class and more. This course focuses on writing for social advocacy, and a wide range of writing styles, comfort, and experience are welcome","Kelow-Bennett, Lydia  ",WGS,433,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Black Queer Studies,3,,,,WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240).,,May be elected twice for credit.

"Advanced Topics in Gender, Culture, and Representation","The age-old saying, “beauty is only skin deep,” tells us that physical attractiveness does not account for more meaningful qualities like character, intelligence, and goodness. But throughout American history, “beauty” has been used as a proxy to determine racial difference and at the same time, to ascertain those more meaningful personal characteristics. Throughout this course, we will examine the various ways in which Americans have used determinants of beauty (e.g., body size, skin color, height, musculature, hair texture, facial symmetry, etc.) to racialize and subsequently, rank and place value on people. Starting with Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) and ending with current-day discussions of beauty and race (e.g., the Kardashians, racial discrimination in online dating), the course will cover several topics including the black is beautiful movement, pageants, interracial dating, colorism, and debates over cultural appropriation.","Purkiss, Ava  ",WGS,434,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001, - Skin Deep: Race and Beauty in American Culture,4,ULWR,,,WGS/AMCULT 240 (WOMENSTD/AMCULT 240).,,May be elected twice for credit.  
"Advanced Topics in Gender, Culture, and Representation","Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan Quartet has sold more than 10 million copies in 40 countries. Some have called it a Harry Potter saga for adults. But Ferrante does not build a fantastic universe of wizards, patronuses, and magical trains. On the contrary, the quartet’s portrayal of female friendship, motherhood, and family unfolds against the backdrop of a very distinct and underexplored Italian past. And yet despite being rooted in the particularities of Italian urban life, Ferrante’s saga has become a global phenomenon. What makes it so appealing to audiences all over the world? In this class, we will read all four of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels and discuss its peculiar place (and the place of Italy more broadly) in World Literature. We will pay special attention to how the Neapolitan novels challenge notions of authorship and shine a light on the crucial role of translation in the global circulation of literature.

"Advanced Topics in Gender, Culture, and Representation","Well-behaved women, it is said, seldom make history. This class will examine the rhetoric of diverse women activists, reformers, and artists who did not “behave”—indeed, who were often seen as a danger to the social order. We’ll consider their efforts in the name of economic and social justice, peace, racial equality, reproductive freedom, and voting rights, as well as opposition to these movements. The Progressive era (c. 1890-1920) was an intense period of women’s activism—including women of color—with inspirational and cautionary lessons for today. How did these rhetors use language to effect social change? How did they challenge commonplace beliefs about how women’s rights and roles? What makes public women seem so dangerous to begin with?

Concurrently, do these narratives about women privilege one type of woman over another? More importantly, how do we understand and interrogate these questions within non-western and global contexts? This course will delve into the multiple subjectivities, socio-cultural geographies, media practices and political activism that is folded into the category called ‘women’s cinema’. Beginning with an exploration of the 1970s “cine-feminism” that focused on women’s filmmaking and political activism, we will expand our discussion to transnational contexts and explore how feminist politics advocated by female and male filmmakers influence an understanding of women-oriented issues, forms, and values in circulation. We will examine women’s films produced within national and transnational geo-cultural spaces posing questions about national versus exilic or postcolonial auteur subjectivities. In doing so we will analyze the films’ aesthetics, institutional context of production, global circulation and situate them within the larger theoretical framework of feminist film theory, female vs. male authorship, postcolonial studies and transnational feminist scholarship.

In contrast, this course approaches diagnoses as social artifacts and collective achievements: phenomena created in, and marked by, particular socio-historical contexts. We consider a variety of historical and contemporary diagnoses, but focus on medical categories related to sexuality, sex, and gender (e.g., onanism, hysteria, nymphomania, inversion, homosexuality, FSD, GID, ED, and the paraphilias). Along the way we consider issues of power and social control, as well as various diagnosis-related phenomena (e.g. disease mongering, diagnostic advocacy, enhancements and ""lifestyle"" drugs, the rise of diagnostic biopsychiatry, and medical social control).","McGann, PJ  ",WGS,449,"Winter 2022, ",Section 001,,3,,,,,,May not be repeated for credit.

We will reflect on how different sociopolitical contexts contribute to the construction of femininity and masculinity in society and regulate sexuality. We will analyze the construction of the female character in movies such as, on the one hand, an “object of desire” and, on the other hand, a “monstrous feminine” (Barbara Creed). We will examine the social construction of masculinity between hegemonic and contra-hegemonic models and stereotypes considering famous movies such as “Plata Quemada” and “Fresa y Chocolate.” Finally, we will close the course with a section dedicated to the queer gaze and movies by Pedro Almodóvar, Anna Muylaert, and Sebastián Lelio.

Honors Thesis,"WOMENSTD 490 and 491 should be elected during the senior year by students writing Honors theses. Students may elect between 2 and 6 credits over the course of the academic year.
The Honors Thesis

The thesis may take a variety of forms, for example:  an activism project, a research project, or a creative or performance piece.  Whatever the form of the thesis, it must include a piece of scholarly writing that reflects the student’s engagement with Women’s Studies.  Given the interdisciplinary nature of the Women’s Studies Program, the honors thesis advisor has the responsibility of determining the appropriate methodology, length, and format of the thesis, based on disciplinary norms and expectations.  These expectations should be established clearly, and the specific plans for the thesis (kind of supervision and form of thesis) should be discussed and agreed upon by the thesis advisor and the student early on.  

Selection of an appropriate thesis advisor is crucial to the success of the Honors thesis.   Only members of the Women’s Studies faculty may serve as Honors thesis advisors in Women’s Studies.    Go to http://www.lsa.umich.edu/women/about/facultyalpha.htm  for faculty listings.

During the senior year, Honors majos register for WOMENSTD 490 the first term and WOMENSTD 491 the second term.  In these independent study courses they conduct the research and writing for the thesis under the close faculty supervision of the thesis advisor.  At the beginning of the Fall Semester, the student should provide the  thesis advisor with a Plan of Study that includes 1) a research proposal, 2) a list of research and writing goals for the Fall semester 3) a research schedule indicating when and how the student will accomplish his/her research and writing goals, and 4) a preliminary bibliography.   The advisor should approve the plan of study no later than the 3rd week of the semester.  At the end of the semester, both the student and the thesis advisor will submit reports on the student’s progress to the Director of Undergraduate Studies for review. 

To register for WOMENSTD 490 and 491 the student should submit the independent study form signed by the thesis advisor to the Women’s Studies office staff.  The staff will then add an electronic override and the student may register for the course the following business day. 

The student may receive a ""Y"" grade in WOMENSTD 490 until the thesis is completed. In the case of a “Y” grade, the thesis advisor submits a Supplemental Grade Report when the thesis is completed or the student formally exits the Honors Program.

The Second Reader

                The second reader of the thesis is a faculty member chosen jointly by the student and the thesis advisor by the end of the fall semester of the senior year.  The second reader need not be affiliated with the Women's Studies Program, but his or her area of expertise should be relevant to the thesis topic.   The contribution of the second reader may vary, but the student should consult with the second reader while s/he is writing the thesis, and the second reader should comment on thesis drafts as well as contribute to the final evaluation of the thesis. 

Completing the Honors Thesis

                The thesis is to be submitted to both the thesis advisor and the second reader no later than the last day of classes in the term in which the student intends to graduate.  (Graduating seniors will have already submitted their Honors Concentration Release form, Honors Card, and diploma application to the Honors Program, and completed a distribution worksheet with a General Advisor.)  The student should also submit three copies of the thesis, with a cover sheet that includes the thesis title, student name, thesis advisor name and telephone number, and second reader name to the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Women's Studies for the Undergraduate Committee.    

The thesis advisor and the second reader  determine whether the thesis should receive an Honors notation and may recommend  what kind of notation it should receive.   The faculty members of the Undergraduate Committee will read all theses that have been deemed worthy of an Honors notation and assign a notation of ""Honors,"" ""High Honors,"" or ""Highest Honors,"" to each one. Not more than one week after graduation the Director of Undergraduate Studies will inform the student, the advisor, and the second reader of the Honors notation the thesis has been awarded. The Director of Undergraduate Studies then forwards the student name, thesis title, and Honors notation to the Honors Program.

                The Honors notation is recorded on the student's diploma and transcript.  There will be no notation on the diploma or transcript if the student receives no honors.

                The student should provide one bound copy of the thesis to be kept on file in the Women’s Studies Program Office.
