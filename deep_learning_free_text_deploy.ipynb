      "Fresh Honors  In this course, we’ll read a series of works from Greco-Roman antiquity long held to be among the “Great Books” of world literature. We’ll explore the ways in which these texts can still speak to us today because of their remarkably intense focus on central questions of human existence, such as: What makes you who you are? What makes a good life? What is justice? What is your relation to people different from yourself, whether because of their ethnicity, class, or gender? At the same time, however, we’ll ask why these texts, in particular, became “Great Books” because of the answers they provide to these questions, and whether these answers are still our answers. Students will, in addition, have the opportunity to write about modern books and films that are related to the ancient texts but come from diverse perspectives and national traditions.

Leveraging the topics covered in Information Visualization I, we introduce interactive techniques that can be used broadly for visualization. The course will also introduce techniques for visualizing specific data types: temporal, network, hierarchical, and text.\n",
      "Information visualization is a crucial step in both understanding and communicating data. In the first Information Visualization course we focused on the fundamental principles behind visualization--the most basic types of data, encodings, and the perceptual and cognitive processes that make some visualizations better than others. This class will expand on these basic principles to include interactivity. We will see how interactivity can act as a boost to expressiveness and effectiveness by studying a handful of common cross-cutting techniques. The class will also expand on the basic data types to feature techniques for visualizing multivariate datasets, temporal data, network, hierarchical, and text. We will focus on general techniques but also focus on specific real-world case studies for each type. Beyond the theoretical, the course will allow students to build on their Altair expertise to build more sophisticated and interactive visualizations. We will also introduce other libraries as needed for the more rarified data types (e.g., NetworkX).\n",
