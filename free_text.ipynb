       "['This course seeks to introduce students to everyday life in urban Africa. The course is designed to equip students with basic and useful knowledge about the how urban residents – rich and poor, newcomers and old-timers, young and old, men and women – negotiate the challenges of living in cities.  This course focuses on networks, associational life, and relationships that are the ties that bind urban residents together.  Social organization, religious belief and practice, ethnicity, economic and political systems, the arts, and popular culture are some of the topics we will explore.  We will be approaching these themes from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including history, anthropology, literature, political science, sociology, and economics.',\n",
       " 'This seminar introduces first-year students to the intellectual community of humanities scholars working in the field of Afroamerican and African studies.  The topic of the seminar varies from year to year.',\n",
       " 'This course is an introduction to spoken and written Swahili. It is designed to help students learn elementary spoken Swahili and the proper written grammar of the language. The course provides some exposure to the people and cultures of the Swahili-speaking communities.',\n",
       " 'This course is designed to introduce the Yoruba language and culture to non-native speakers.  Emphasis will be put on listening, speaking, reading and writing through communicative activities, enabling the students to perform the various tasks in the target language. Classes will also include role-plays and oral presentations.',\n",
       " 'Is the African Diaspora a concept or an actual geographical location? Is it singular or are there multiple African diasporas? What does diaspora have to do with the multi-lingual, multicultural continent of over fifty countries that make up Africa? What impact has Africa and its diaspora(s) had on the so-called “white” West and its development as a site of tremendous wealth and privilege? AAS 202 engages these questions by exploring the long historical, economic, and political relationships between \"the West\" (e.g., United States, Britain, France, and Germany) and selected countries in Africa and the diaspora (e.g., Jamaica, Haiti, Brazil, Mali, Liberia, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Africa). Topics include: pre-colonial African empires; the Middle Passage; child soldiers; public health; conflict minerals; slavery and resistance; migration; empire, colonialism, and post-colonialism; twentieth-century freedom movements; religion; and popular forms of cultural expression.',\n",
       " 'This course concentrates on developing communicative skills to enable the learners engage in meaningful verbal interactions with other Swahili speakers. In order to achieve this goal, most lessons are task-based, both pedagogic and real-life tasks. Activities such as role-play, creating sample materials, discussion, storytelling, describing scenes, and studying authentic cultural objects are used.  Reading and writing passages are carried out as would be in a Swahili speaking community.  Prerequisite: AAS 116 or permission from the instructor after testing.',\n",
       " 'This intermediate level course sequence is designed for students who have successfully completed the Elementary sequence, or with the permission of the instructor. Instruction is offered through a distance-learning, course share program at Indiana University. It broadens speaking, reading and writing skills as students engage in discussions and writing on more complex topics. Videos, audio tapes, newspapers, magazines and the internet provide resources for the content of materials of the students’ interests as well as exposure to more advanced language. They are encouraged to discuss culture as well as news from Africa. Students begin to read short novels, plays, poetry, and essays. Using a variety of materials, students acquire a solid knowledge of morphology and syntax, vocabulary, and more complex practice in speaking and writing. Swahili is currently the only language available at the Intermediate level, but additional languages may be added in the future.',\n",
       " 'The history of early Africa is expansive, encompassing several millennia and several thousands of square miles. It entails the peopling of a continent, the rise of centralized kingdoms and long-distance trade networks, technological innovation, the birth of diverse cultural forms and social identities, violent confrontations, and creative ideas about what it means to live together. It is also a difficult history to access as most African civilizations before the 19th century prioritized unwritten forms of communication. This class presents several important episodes in the long history of early African civilization and introduces students to the ways historians of the distant past think about and use various forms of evidence including language, material culture, oral traditions, and folklore.',\n",
       " 'The course introduces students to the confluence of political and economic forces at the local,\\r\\nnational, regional, and global levels that have helped shape the trajectory of African development.\\r\\nThe course is divided into three parts: the first examines the meaning and evolution of the political\\r\\neconomy of development in the context of Africa’s unfolding history from pre-independence\\r\\nthrough the era of structural adjustment. The second applies an understanding of political economy\\r\\nto topical development issues such as environment and climate change, causes and consequences of\\r\\nconflict, health and development, and international aid. The latter section applies the political\\r\\neconomy framework to particular African country case studies.',\n",
       " 'In this course we will study the emergence and early development of African American literature, from 1773 to the Harlem Renaissance. We will do literary close readings of texts to think through many of the issues relating to the development of an African American literary tradition. What constitutes a tradition? Can there be more than one? Along with these questions, we will examine our own assumptions about this literature and the many ways in which these texts reflect the different experiences of African Americans intent on gaining a national voice in a slaveholding and racially polarized nation.']"

       "'\\n\\n\\nThis course provides an introduction to Polish culture in the larger context of Slavic and Central European cultures through a detailed study and analysis of “music of protest” (jazz, cabaret, rock, punk) during the 1945-1989 period of Soviet dominance and during the period of transition to democracy and after the establishment of full democratic rule in Poland. This course also provides an introduction to rhetoric and contextual reading of poetry (as well as other forms of expression). We will study in detail texts by some of the most important Polish and other Central European pop, jazz, cabaret, rock, and punk authors and bands with the purpose of identifying devices and strategies used to create meanings. We will connect texts with elements of the daily lives of people in Poland (as well as other Central European nations) focusing in particular on: cultural heritage, history, politics, social issues, past and future myths (interpretations of past events and projections of perceived “national goals” into the future). We will study and discuss the “romantic pose” of rock poets (poet as a prophet —  the 19th-century concept created by Polish Romantic poets in the context of constructing art as an instrument of the Polish “battle for freedom and independence”). Specifically, we will investigate the “Polish trend” to build poetic texts on the foundation of ideas (rock poetry as an extension of discourse on ideas). We will compare Polish rock poetry to British and American rock poetry to highlight the dominance of “word and meaning” in Polish rock and punk of the 1980s and 2000s. Other topics will include: \\r\\n\\n totalitarian structures and poetic response to totalitarian structures, \\r\\n the three taboos in Polish culture (communism, Catholicism, anti-communist opposition), \\r\\n the quest for utopia,  \\r\\nthe “apologetic nature” of Polish art,  \\r\\nthe fear of and desire for diversity in Polish culture and history, \\r\\n the construction of a “collective Polish psyche”.\\r\\n\\n This course addresses a wide range of issues related to the study of history, literature, culture, social and cultural transformations, construction and deconstruction of national, social, and gender mythologies and perceptions. It will focus on responses to the imposition of totalitarian structures and survival within them, responses to historical changes, as well as strategies for constructing national consensus and for dealing with a diversity of ideas and attitudes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis course will focus on Polish culture but will do so in a global context: it will introduce the students to general and foundational concepts and ideas in communication, semiotics, rhetoric, and the reading of poetic texts. The focus on comprehension of complex synthetic art forms in a social, historical, and political context can be applied to other cultures as well (Polish, Slavic, non-Slavic, past, and contemporary). Polish culture will be analyzed in terms of its main building blocks: ethnicity, religion, gender, cultural identity, the importance of ideas and verbal communication, the opposition between the West and the East, the opposition between Enlightenment and Romanticism, opposition between faith and fact, the opposition between real and perceived continuity of history and culture. In the process, Polish culture will be defined in all its distinctiveness but with clear attention to the qualities shared with the cultures of other Slavic and Central European nations and states. Students will analyze how literary and non-literary texts (verbal and non-verbal) are constructed, how meanings are created and transmitted, how real and perceived connections between the author and the audience are developed.\\r\\n\\r\\n  This will allow students to enhance their talents for persuasive and expository presentations and allow them to become “intentional” communicators and receivers of communication. Students will be exposed to the full range of human experiences in the face of war, human rights abuses, totalitarian rule, revolution, and political, social, and cultural transformation.Course Requirements:\\nAttendance; \\r\\nRegular short participation tests; \\r\\nFinal exam. \\r\\n1 argumentative paper (8-12 pages). \\r\\n1 research paper (8-12 pages).\\r\\nIntended Audience:Students seeking to broaden their understanding of foundational concepts in popular culture and its interaction with politics and basic strategies and devices in rhetoric/communication. Students pursuing Slavic majors/minors and seeking to expand their knowledge beyond their primary Slavic field.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo prior knowledge of the Polish language and culture is needed. '"
