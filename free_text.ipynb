       "['This course seeks to introduce students to everyday life in urban Africa. The course is designed to equip students with basic and useful knowledge about the how urban residents – rich and poor, newcomers and old-timers, young and old, men and women – negotiate the challenges of living in cities.  This course focuses on networks, associational life, and relationships that are the ties that bind urban residents together.  Social organization, religious belief and practice, ethnicity, economic and political systems, the arts, and popular culture are some of the topics we will explore.  We will be approaching these themes from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including history, anthropology, literature, political science, sociology, and economics.',\n",
       " 'This seminar introduces first-year students to the intellectual community of humanities scholars working in the field of Afroamerican and African studies.  The topic of the seminar varies from year to year.',\n",
       " 'This course is an introduction to spoken and written Swahili. It is designed to help students learn elementary spoken Swahili and the proper written grammar of the language. The course provides some exposure to the people and cultures of the Swahili-speaking communities.',\n",
       " 'This course is designed to introduce the Yoruba language and culture to non-native speakers.  Emphasis will be put on listening, speaking, reading and writing through communicative activities, enabling the students to perform the various tasks in the target language. Classes will also include role-plays and oral presentations.',\n",
       " 'Is the African Diaspora a concept or an actual geographical location? Is it singular or are there multiple African diasporas? What does diaspora have to do with the multi-lingual, multicultural continent of over fifty countries that make up Africa? What impact has Africa and its diaspora(s) had on the so-called “white” West and its development as a site of tremendous wealth and privilege? AAS 202 engages these questions by exploring the long historical, economic, and political relationships between \"the West\" (e.g., United States, Britain, France, and Germany) and selected countries in Africa and the diaspora (e.g., Jamaica, Haiti, Brazil, Mali, Liberia, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Africa). Topics include: pre-colonial African empires; the Middle Passage; child soldiers; public health; conflict minerals; slavery and resistance; migration; empire, colonialism, and post-colonialism; twentieth-century freedom movements; religion; and popular forms of cultural expression.',\n",
       " 'This course concentrates on developing communicative skills to enable the learners engage in meaningful verbal interactions with other Swahili speakers. In order to achieve this goal, most lessons are task-based, both pedagogic and real-life tasks. Activities such as role-play, creating sample materials, discussion, storytelling, describing scenes, and studying authentic cultural objects are used.  Reading and writing passages are carried out as would be in a Swahili speaking community.  Prerequisite: AAS 116 or permission from the instructor after testing.',\n",
       " 'This intermediate level course sequence is designed for students who have successfully completed the Elementary sequence, or with the permission of the instructor. Instruction is offered through a distance-learning, course share program at Indiana University. It broadens speaking, reading and writing skills as students engage in discussions and writing on more complex topics. Videos, audio tapes, newspapers, magazines and the internet provide resources for the content of materials of the students’ interests as well as exposure to more advanced language. They are encouraged to discuss culture as well as news from Africa. Students begin to read short novels, plays, poetry, and essays. Using a variety of materials, students acquire a solid knowledge of morphology and syntax, vocabulary, and more complex practice in speaking and writing. Swahili is currently the only language available at the Intermediate level, but additional languages may be added in the future.',\n",
       " 'The history of early Africa is expansive, encompassing several millennia and several thousands of square miles. It entails the peopling of a continent, the rise of centralized kingdoms and long-distance trade networks, technological innovation, the birth of diverse cultural forms and social identities, violent confrontations, and creative ideas about what it means to live together. It is also a difficult history to access as most African civilizations before the 19th century prioritized unwritten forms of communication. This class presents several important episodes in the long history of early African civilization and introduces students to the ways historians of the distant past think about and use various forms of evidence including language, material culture, oral traditions, and folklore.',\n",
       " 'The course introduces students to the confluence of political and economic forces at the local,\\r\\nnational, regional, and global levels that have helped shape the trajectory of African development.\\r\\nThe course is divided into three parts: the first examines the meaning and evolution of the political\\r\\neconomy of development in the context of Africa’s unfolding history from pre-independence\\r\\nthrough the era of structural adjustment. The second applies an understanding of political economy\\r\\nto topical development issues such as environment and climate change, causes and consequences of\\r\\nconflict, health and development, and international aid. The latter section applies the political\\r\\neconomy framework to particular African country case studies.',\n",
       " 'In this course we will study the emergence and early development of African American literature, from 1773 to the Harlem Renaissance. We will do literary close readings of texts to think through many of the issues relating to the development of an African American literary tradition. What constitutes a tradition? Can there be more than one? Along with these questions, we will examine our own assumptions about this literature and the many ways in which these texts reflect the different experiences of African Americans intent on gaining a national voice in a slaveholding and racially polarized nation.']"
